; Method arguments were being checked for collisions at the global scope before
; the method object was created by the parser.  Because of this, false 
; collisions could occur that would cause the following error message to be 
; produced:
;
;    Redefinition of value named 'X' in the 'int *' type plane!
;
; Fixed by delaying binding of variable names until _after_ the method symtab is
; created.

%X = global int 4

declare int "xxx"(int * %X)
