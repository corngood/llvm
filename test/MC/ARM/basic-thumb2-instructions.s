@ Check that the assembler can handle the documented syntax from the ARM ARM.
@ For complex constructs like shifter operands, check more thoroughly for them
@ once then spot check that following instructions accept the form generally.
@ This gives us good coverage while keeping the overall size of the test
@ more reasonable.


@ FIXME: Some 3-operand instructions have a 2-operand assembly syntax.
