We're mostly checking that relocations are applied correctly
here. Currently R_AARCH64_ABS32 is used for references to debug data
and R_AARCH64_ABS64 is used for program addresses.

A couple of ABS32s, both at 0 and elsewhere, interpreted correctly:

CHECK: DW_AT_producer [DW_FORM_strp] ( .debug_str[0x00000000] = "clang version 3.3 ")
CHECK: DW_AT_name [DW_FORM_strp] ( .debug_str[0x00000013] = "tmp.c")

A couple of ABS64s similarly:

CHECK: DW_AT_low_pc [DW_FORM_addr] (0x0000000000000000)
CHECK: DW_AT_high_pc [DW_FORM_addr] (0x000000000000005c)
