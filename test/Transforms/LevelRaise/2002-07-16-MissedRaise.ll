; This case fails raise because the store requires that it's argument is of a 
; particular type, but the gep is unable to propogate types backwards through 
; it, because it doesn't know what type to ask it's operand to be.
;
; This could be fixed by making all stores add themselves to a list, and check
; their arguments are consistent AFTER all other values are propogated.
