; edgefailure - This function illustrates how SCCP is not doing it's job.  This
; function should be optimized almost completely away: the loop should be
; analyzed to detect that the body executes exactly once, and thus the branch
; can be eliminated and code becomes trivially dead.  This is distilled from a
; real benchmark (mst from Olden benchmark, MakeGraph function).  When SCCP is
; fixed, this should be eliminated by a single SCCP application.
