;; X's live range extends beyond the shift, so the register allocator
;; cannot coalesce it with Y.  Because of this, a copy needs to be
;; emitted before the shift to save the register value before it is

;; allocator turns the shift into an LEA.  This also occurs for ADD.

; Check that the shift gets turned into an LEA.
