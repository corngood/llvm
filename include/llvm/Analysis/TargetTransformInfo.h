// This pass exposes codegen information to IR-level passes. Every
// transformation that uses codegen information is broken into three parts:
// 1. The IR-level analysis pass.
// 2. The IR-level transformation interface which provides the needed
//    information.
// 3. Codegen-level implementation which uses target-specific hooks.
//
// This file defines #2, which is the interface that IR-level transformations
// use for querying the codegen.
