// This file defines the following classes:
//  1. ETNode:  A node in the ET forest.
//  2. ETOccurrence: An occurrence of the node in the splay tree
//  storing the DFS path information.
//
//  The ET-forest structure is described in:
//    D. D. Sleator and R. E. Tarjan. A data structure for dynamic trees.
//    J.  G'omput. System Sci., 26(3):362 381, 1983.
//
// Basically, the ET-Forest is storing the dominator tree (ETNode),
// and a splay tree containing the depth first path information for
// those nodes (ETOccurrence).  This enables us to answer queries
// about domination (DominatedBySlow), and ancestry (NCA) in
// logarithmic time, and perform updates to the information in
// logarithmic time.

  /*
   Given a dominator tree, we can determine whether one thing
   dominates another in constant time by using two DFS numbers:
  
   1. The number for when we visit a node on the way down the tree
   2. The number for when we visit a node on the way back up the tree
  
   You can view these as bounds for the range of dfs numbers the
   nodes in the subtree of the dominator tree rooted at that node
   will contain.
  
   The dominator tree is always a simple acyclic tree, so there are
   only three possible relations two nodes in the dominator tree have
   to each other:
  
   1. Node A is above Node B (and thus, Node A dominates node B)
  
        A
        |
        C
       / \ 
      B   D
  
  
   In the above case, DFS_Number_In of A will be <= DFS_Number_In of
   B, and DFS_Number_Out of A will be >= DFS_Number_Out of B.  This is
   because we must hit A in the dominator tree *before* B on the walk
   down, and we will hit A *after* B on the walk back up
  
   2. Node A is below node B (and thus, node B dominates node B)
       
        B
        |
        A
       / \ 
      C   D
  
   In the above case, DFS_Number_In of A will be >= DFS_Number_In of
   B, and DFS_Number_Out of A will be <= DFS_Number_Out of B.
  
   This is because we must hit A in the dominator tree *after* B on
   the walk down, and we will hit A *before* B on the walk back up
  
   3. Node A and B are siblings (and thus, neither dominates the other)
  
        C
        |
        D
       / \                        
      A   B
  
   In the above case, DFS_Number_In of A will *always* be <=
   DFS_Number_In of B, and DFS_Number_Out of A will *always* be <=
   DFS_Number_Out of B.  This is because we will always finish the dfs
   walk of one of the subtrees before the other, and thus, the dfs
   numbers for one subtree can't intersect with the range of dfs
   numbers for the other subtree.  If you swap A and B's position in
   the dominator tree, the comparison changes direction, but the point
   is that both comparisons will always go the same way if there is no
   dominance relationship.
  
   Thus, it is sufficient to write
  
   A_Dominates_B(node A, node B) {
      return DFS_Number_In(A) <= DFS_Number_In(B) &&
             DFS_Number_Out(A) >= DFS_Number_Out(B);
   }
  
   A_Dominated_by_B(node A, node B) {
     return DFS_Number_In(A) >= DFS_Number_In(A) &&
            DFS_Number_Out(A) <= DFS_Number_Out(B);
   }

    return this->DFSNumIn >= other->DFSNumIn &&
           this->DFSNumOut <= other->DFSNumOut;

  // be up to date.
