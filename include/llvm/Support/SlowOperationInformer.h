//
// This file defines a simple object which can be used to let the user know what
// is going on when a slow operation is happening, and gives them the ability to
// cancel it.  Potentially slow operations can stack allocate one of these
// objects, and periodically call the "progress" method to update the progress
// bar.  If the operation takes more than 1 second to complete, the progress bar
// is automatically shown and updated.  As such, the slow operation should not
// print stuff to the screen, and should not be confused if an extra line
// appears on the screen (ie, the cursor should be at the start of the line).
//
// If the user presses CTRL-C during the operation, the next invocation of the
// progress method with throw an std::string object indicating that the
// operation was cancelled.  As such, client code must be exception safe around
// the progress method.
//
// Because SlowOperationInformers fiddle around with signals, they cannot be
// nested, and interact poorly with threads.  The SIGALRM handler is set back to
// SIGDFL, but the SIGINT signal handler is restored when the
// SlowOperationInformer is destroyed.
