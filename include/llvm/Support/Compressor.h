  /// This class provides an abstraction for compression and decompression of
  /// a block of memory.  The algorithm used here is currently bzip2 but that
  /// may change without notice. Should newer algorithms prove to compress
  /// bytecode better than bzip2, that newer algorithm will be added, but won't
  /// replace bzip2. This interface allows us to abstract the notion of
  /// compression and deal with alternate compression schemes over time.
  /// The type of compression used can be determined by inspecting the
  /// first byte of the compressed output. Currently value '0' means no
  /// compression was used (for very small files) and value '2' means bzip2
  /// compression was used.  The Compressor is intended for use with memory
  /// mapped files where the entire data block to be compressed or decompressed
  /// is available in memory. However, output can be gathered in repeated calls
  /// to a callback.  Utilities for sending compressed or decompressed output
  /// to a stream or directly to a memory block are also provided.
