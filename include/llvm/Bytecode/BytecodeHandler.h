/// This class provides the interface for handling bytecode events during
/// reading of bytecode. The methods on this interface are invoked by the
/// BytecodeReader as it discovers the content of a bytecode stream.
/// This class provides a a clear separation of concerns between recognizing
/// the semantic units of a bytecode file (the Reader) and deciding what to do
/// with them (the Handler).
///
/// The BytecodeReader recognizes the content of the bytecode file and
/// calls the BytecodeHandler methods to let it perform additional tasks. This
/// arrangement allows Bytecode files to be read and handled for a number of
/// purposes simply by creating a subclass of BytecodeHandler. None of the
/// parsing details need to be understood, only the meaning of the calls
/// made on this interface.
