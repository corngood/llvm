// This functionality is implemented by the lib/Bytecode/Reader library.
// It is used to read VM bytecode files from a file or memory buffer
// and print out a diagnostic analysis of the contents of the file. It is
// intended for three uses: (a) understanding the bytecode format, (b) ensuring
// correctness of bytecode format, (c) statistical analysis of generated
// bytecode files.
