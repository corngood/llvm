    /// AscizDirective - If not null, this allows for special handling of

    /// ".asciz".  If a target doesn't support this, it can be set to null.
    const char *AscizDirective;  // Defaults to "\t.asciz\t"

    /// boundary.

    /// AlignmentIsInBytes - If this is true (the default) then the asmprinter
    /// emits ".align N" directives, where N is the number of bytes to align to.
    /// Otherwise, it emits ".align log2(N)", e.g. 3 to align to an 8 byte
    /// boundary.

    //===--- Section Switching Directives ---------------------------------===//

    /// emit a global to an arbitrary section.  The section name is emited after
    /// this.
    const char *SwitchToSectionDirective;  // Defaults to "\t.section\t"

    /// before emitting the constant pool for a function.

    /// a section to emit the static constructor list.

    /// LCOMMDirective - This is the name of a directive (if supported) that can

    /// initialized data in the .bss/.data section.  The syntax expected is:

    const char *COMMDirective;           // Defaults to "\t.comm\t".
    
    /// COMMDirectiveTakesAlignment - True if COMMDirective take a third
    /// argument that specifies the alignment of the declaration.
    bool COMMDirectiveTakesAlignment;    // Defaults to true.
    
    /// HasDotTypeDotSizeDirective - True if the target has .type and .size
    /// directives, this is true for most ELF targets.
