/// MachineCodeEmitter - This class defines two sorts of methods: those for
/// emitting the actual bytes of machine code, and those for emitting auxillary
/// structures, such as jump tables, relocations, etc.
///
/// Emission of machine code is complicated by the fact that we don't (in
/// general) know the size of the machine code that we're about to emit before
/// we emit it.  As such, we preallocate a certain amount of memory, and set the
/// BufferBegin/BufferEnd pointers to the start and end of the buffer.  As we
/// emit machine instructions, we advance the CurBufferPtr to indicate the
/// location of the next byte to emit.  In the case of a buffer overflow (we
/// need to emit more machine code than we have allocated space for), the
/// CurBufferPtr will saturate to BufferEnd and ignore stores.  Once the entire
/// function has been emitted, the overflow condition is checked, and if it has
/// occurred, more memory is allocated, and we reemit the code into it.
