<p>The LLVM target-independent code generator is a framework that provides a
suite of reusable components for translating the LLVM internal representation to
the machine code for a specified target -- either in assembly form (suitable for
a static compiler) or in binary machine code format (usable for a JIT compiler).
The LLVM target-independent code generator consists of five main components:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#targetdesc">Abstract target description</a> interfaces which
capture important properties about various aspects of the machine, independently
of how they will be used.  These interfaces are defined in
<tt>include/llvm/Target/</tt>.</li>

<li>Classes used to represent the <a href="#codegendesc">machine code</a> being
generated for a target.  These classes are intended to be abstract enough to
represent the machine code for <i>any</i> target machine.  These classes are
defined in <tt>include/llvm/CodeGen/</tt>.</li>

<li><a href="#codegenalgs">Target-independent algorithms</a> used to implement
various phases of native code generation (register allocation, scheduling, stack
frame representation, etc).  This code lives in <tt>lib/CodeGen/</tt>.</li>

<li><a href="#targetimpls">Implementations of the abstract target description
interfaces</a> for particular targets.  These machine descriptions make use of
the components provided by LLVM, and can optionally provide custom
target-specific passes, to build complete code generators for a specific target.
Target descriptions live in <tt>lib/Target/</tt>.</li>

<li><a href="#jit">The target-independent JIT components</a>.  The LLVM JIT is
completely target independent (it uses the <tt>TargetJITInfo</tt> structure to
interface for target-specific issues.  The code for the target-independent
JIT lives in <tt>lib/ExecutionEngine/JIT</tt>.</li>

</ol>

<p>
Depending on which part of the code generator you are interested in working on,
different pieces of this will be useful to you.  In any case, you should be
familiar with the <a href="#targetdesc">target description</a> and <a
href="#codegendesc">machine code representation</a> classes.  If you want to add
a backend for a new target, you will need to <a href="#targetimpls">implement the
target description</a> classes for your new target and understand the <a
href="LangRef.html">LLVM code representation</a>.  If you are interested in
implementing a new <a href="#codegenalgs">code generation algorithm</a>, it
should only depend on the target-description and machine code representation
classes, ensuring that it is portable.
</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection">
 <a name="required">Required components in the code generator</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The two pieces of the LLVM code generator are the high-level interface to the
code generator and the set of reusable components that can be used to build
target-specific backends.  The two most important interfaces (<a
href="#targetmachine"><tt>TargetMachine</tt></a> and <a
href="#targetdata"><tt>TargetData</tt></a>) are the only ones that are
required to be defined for a backend to fit into the LLVM system, but the others
must be defined if the reusable code generator components are going to be
used.</p>

<p>This design has two important implications.  The first is that LLVM can
support completely non-traditional code generation targets.  For example, the C
backend does not require register allocation, instruction selection, or any of
the other standard components provided by the system.  As such, it only
implements these two interfaces, and does its own thing.  Another example of a
code generator like this is a (purely hypothetical) backend that converts LLVM
to the GCC RTL form and uses GCC to emit machine code for a target.</p>

<p>This design also implies that it is possible to design and
implement radically different code generators in the LLVM system that do not
make use of any of the built-in components.  Doing so is not recommended at all,
but could be required for radically different targets that do not fit into the
LLVM machine description model: programmable FPGAs for example.</p>

<p><b>Important Note:</b> For historical reasons, the LLVM SparcV9 code
generator uses almost entirely different code paths than described in this
document.  For this reason, there are some deprecated interfaces (such as
<tt>TargetSchedInfo</tt>), which are only used by the
V9 backend and should not be used by any other targets.  Also, all code in the
<tt>lib/Target/SparcV9</tt> directory and subdirectories should be considered
deprecated, and should not be used as the basis for future code generator work.
The SparcV9 backend is slowly being merged into the rest of the
target-independent code generators, but this is a low-priority process with no
predictable completion date.</p>

<div class="doc_subsection">
 <a name="high-level-design">The high-level design of the code generator</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The LLVM target-independent code generator is designed to support efficient and
quality code generation for standard register-based microprocessors.  Code
generation in this model is divided into the following stages:</p>

<ol>
<li><b><a href="#instselect">Instruction Selection</a></b> - This phase
determines an efficient way to express the input LLVM code in the target
instruction set.
This stage produces the initial code for the program in the target instruction
set, then makes use of virtual registers in SSA form and physical registers that
represent any required register assignments due to target constraints or calling
conventions.  This step turns the LLVM code into a DAG of target
instructions.</li>

<li><b><a href="#selectiondag_sched">Scheduling and Formation</a></b> - This
phase takes the DAG of target instructions produced by the instruction selection
phase, determines an ordering of the instructions, then emits the instructions
as <tt><a href="#machineinstr">MachineInstr</a></tt>s with that ordering.  Note
that we describe this in the <a href="#instselect">instruction selection
section</a> because it operates on a <a
href="#selectiondag_intro">SelectionDAG</a>.
</li>

<li><b><a href="#ssamco">SSA-based Machine Code Optimizations</a></b> - This 
optional stage consists of a series of machine-code optimizations that 
operate on the SSA-form produced by the instruction selector.  Optimizations 
like modulo-scheduling or peephole optimization work here.
</li>

<li><b><a href="#regalloc">Register Allocation</a></b> - The
target code is transformed from an infinite virtual register file in SSA form 
to the concrete register file used by the target.  This phase introduces spill 
code and eliminates all virtual register references from the program.</li>

<li><b><a href="#proepicode">Prolog/Epilog Code Insertion</a></b> - Once the 
machine code has been generated for the function and the amount of stack space 
required is known (used for LLVM alloca's and spill slots), the prolog and 
epilog code for the function can be inserted and "abstract stack location 
references" can be eliminated.  This stage is responsible for implementing 
optimizations like frame-pointer elimination and stack packing.</li>

<li><b><a href="#latemco">Late Machine Code Optimizations</a></b> - Optimizations
that operate on "final" machine code can go here, such as spill code scheduling
and peephole optimizations.</li>

<li><b><a href="#codeemit">Code Emission</a></b> - The final stage actually 
puts out the code for the current function, either in the target assembler 
format or in machine code.</li>

</ol>

<p>
The code generator is based on the assumption that the instruction selector will
use an optimal pattern matching selector to create high-quality sequences of
native instructions.  Alternative code generator designs based on pattern 
expansion and
aggressive iterative peephole optimization are much slower.  This design 
permits efficient compilation (important for JIT environments) and
aggressive optimization (used when generating code offline) by allowing 
components of varying levels of sophistication to be used for any step of 
compilation.</p>

<p>
In addition to these stages, target implementations can insert arbitrary
target-specific passes into the flow.  For example, the X86 target uses a
special pass to handle the 80x87 floating point stack architecture.  Other
targets with unusual requirements can be supported with custom passes as needed.

<div class="doc_subsection">
 <a name="tablegen">Using TableGen for target description</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The target description classes require a detailed description of the target
architecture.  These target descriptions often have a large amount of common
information (e.g., an <tt>add</tt> instruction is almost identical to a 
<tt>sub</tt> instruction).
In order to allow the maximum amount of commonality to be factored out, the LLVM
code generator uses the <a href="TableGenFundamentals.html">TableGen</a> tool to
describe big chunks of the target machine, which allows the use of
domain-specific and target-specific abstractions to reduce the amount of 
repetition.
</p>

<p>As LLVM continues to be developed and refined, we plan to move more and more
of the target description to be in <tt>.td</tt> form.  Doing so gives us a
number of advantages.  The most important is that it makes it easier to port
LLVM, because it reduces the amount of C++ code that has to be written and the
surface area of the code generator that needs to be understood before someone
can get in an get something working.  Second, it is also important to us because
it makes it easier to change things: in particular, if tables and other things
are all emitted by tblgen, we only need to change one place (tblgen) to update
all of the targets to a new interface.</p>

instructions and registers it has), and do not incorporate any particular pieces

<p>All of the target description classes (except the <tt><a

<tt>TargetRegisterInfo</tt>) is used to describe the register file of the
target and any interactions between the registers.</p>

<p>Registers in the code generator are represented in the code generator by
unsigned numbers.  Physical registers (those that actually exist in the target
description) are unique small numbers, and virtual registers are generally
large.  Note that register #0 is reserved as a flag value.</p>

<p>Each register in the processor description has an associated
<tt>TargetRegisterDesc</tt> entry, which provides a textual name for the register
(used for assembly output and debugging dumps) and a set of aliases (used to
indicate that one register overlaps with another).
</p>

<p>In addition to the per-register description, the <tt>MRegisterInfo</tt> class
exposes a set of processor specific register classes (instances of the
<tt>TargetRegisterClass</tt> class).  Each register class contains sets of
registers that have the same properties (for example, they are all 32-bit
integer registers).  Each SSA virtual register created by the instruction
selector has an associated register class.  When the register allocator runs, it
replaces virtual registers with a physical register in the set.</p>

At the high-level, LLVM code is translated to a machine specific representation

(defined in include/llvm/CodeGen).  This representation is completely target

series of operands.  This representation is designed to support both SSA

  <a name="machineinstr">The <tt>MachineInstr</tt> class</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Target machine instructions are represented as instances of the
<tt>MachineInstr</tt> class.  This class is an extremely abstract way of
representing machine instructions.  In particular, it only keeps track of 
an opcode number and a set of operands.</p>

<p>The opcode number is a simple unsigned number that only has meaning to a 
specific backend.  All of the instructions for a target should be defined in 
the <tt>*InstrInfo.td</tt> file for the target. The opcode enum values
are auto-generated from this description.  The <tt>MachineInstr</tt> class does
not have any information about how to interpret the instruction (i.e., what the 
semantics of the instruction are): for that you must refer to the 
<tt><a href="#targetinstrinfo">TargetInstrInfo</a></tt> class.</p> 

<p>The operands of a machine instruction can be of several different types:
they can be a register reference, constant integer, basic block reference, etc.
In addition, a machine operand should be marked as a def or a use of the value
(though only registers are allowed to be defs).</p>

<p>By convention, the LLVM code generator orders instruction operands so that
all register definitions come before the register uses, even on architectures
that are normally printed in other orders.  For example, the SPARC add 
instruction: "<tt>add %i1, %i2, %i3</tt>" adds the "%i1", and "%i2" registers
and stores the result into the "%i3" register.  In the LLVM code generator,
the operands should be stored as "<tt>%i3, %i1, %i2</tt>": with the destination
first.</p>

<p>Keeping destination (definition) operands at the beginning of the operand 
list has several advantages.  In particular, the debugging printer will print 
the instruction like this:</p>

<pre>
  %r3 = add %i1, %i2
</pre>

<p>If the first operand is a def, and it is also easier to <a

operand.</p>

  <a name="buildmi">Using the <tt>MachineInstrBuilder.h</tt> functions</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>Machine instructions are created by using the <tt>BuildMI</tt> functions,
located in the <tt>include/llvm/CodeGen/MachineInstrBuilder.h</tt> file.  The
<tt>BuildMI</tt> functions make it easy to build arbitrary machine 
instructions.  Usage of the <tt>BuildMI</tt> functions look like this: 
</p>

<pre>
  // Create a 'DestReg = mov 42' (rendered in X86 assembly as 'mov DestReg, 42')
  // instruction.  The '1' specifies how many operands will be added.
  MachineInstr *MI = BuildMI(X86::MOV32ri, 1, DestReg).addImm(42);

  // Create the same instr, but insert it at the end of a basic block.
  MachineBasicBlock &amp;MBB = ...
  BuildMI(MBB, X86::MOV32ri, 1, DestReg).addImm(42);

  // Create the same instr, but insert it before a specified iterator point.
  MachineBasicBlock::iterator MBBI = ...
  BuildMI(MBB, MBBI, X86::MOV32ri, 1, DestReg).addImm(42);

  // Create a 'cmp Reg, 0' instruction, no destination reg.
  MI = BuildMI(X86::CMP32ri, 2).addReg(Reg).addImm(0);
  // Create an 'sahf' instruction which takes no operands and stores nothing.
  MI = BuildMI(X86::SAHF, 0);

  // Create a self looping branch instruction.
  BuildMI(MBB, X86::JNE, 1).addMBB(&amp;MBB);
</pre>

<p>
The key thing to remember with the <tt>BuildMI</tt> functions is that you have
to specify the number of operands that the machine instruction will take. This
allows for efficient memory allocation.  You also need to specify if operands 
default to be uses of values, not definitions.  If you need to add a definition
operand (other than the optional destination register), you must explicitly 
mark it as such.
</p>

<div class="doc_subsubsection">
  <a name="fixedregs">Fixed (preassigned) registers</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>One important issue that the code generator needs to be aware of is the
presence of fixed registers.  In particular, there are often places in the 
instruction stream where the register allocator <em>must</em> arrange for a
particular value to be in a particular register.  This can occur due to 
limitations of the instruction set (e.g., the X86 can only do a 32-bit divide 
with the <tt>EAX</tt>/<tt>EDX</tt> registers), or external factors like calling
conventions.  In any case, the instruction selector should emit code that 
copies a virtual register into or out of a physical register when needed.</p>

<p>For example, consider this simple LLVM example:</p>

<pre>
  int %test(int %X, int %Y) {
    %Z = div int %X, %Y
    ret int %Z
  }
</pre>

<p>The X86 instruction selector produces this machine code for the div 
and ret (use 
"<tt>llc X.bc -march=x86 -print-machineinstrs</tt>" to get this):</p>

<pre>
        ;; Start of div
        %EAX = mov %reg1024           ;; Copy X (in reg1024) into EAX
        %reg1027 = sar %reg1024, 31
        %EDX = mov %reg1027           ;; Sign extend X into EDX
        idiv %reg1025                 ;; Divide by Y (in reg1025)
        %reg1026 = mov %EAX           ;; Read the result (Z) out of EAX

        ;; Start of ret
        %EAX = mov %reg1026           ;; 32-bit return value goes in EAX
        ret
</pre>

<p>By the end of code generation, the register allocator has coalesced
the registers and deleted the resultant identity moves, producing the
following code:</p>

<pre>
        ;; X is in EAX, Y is in ECX
        mov %EAX, %EDX
        sar %EDX, 31
        idiv %ECX
        ret 
</pre>

<p>This approach is extremely general (if it can handle the X86 architecture, 
it can handle anything!) and allows all of the target specific
knowledge about the instruction stream to be isolated in the instruction 
selector.  Note that physical registers should have a short lifetime for good 
code generation, and all physical registers are assumed dead on entry and
exit of basic blocks (before register allocation).  Thus if you need a value
to be live across basic block boundaries, it <em>must</em> live in a virtual 
register.</p>

  <a name="instselect">Instruction Selection</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
Instruction Selection is the process of translating LLVM code presented to the
code generator into target-specific machine instructions.  There are several
well-known ways to do this in the literature.  In LLVM there are two main forms:
the SelectionDAG based instruction selector framework and an old-style 'simple'
instruction selector (which effectively peephole selects each LLVM instruction
into a series of machine instructions).  We recommend that all targets use the
SelectionDAG infrastructure.
</p>

<p>Portions of the DAG instruction selector are generated from the target 
description files (<tt>*.td</tt>) files.  Eventually, we aim for the entire
instruction selector to be generated from these <tt>.td</tt> files.</p>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsubsection">
  <a name="selectiondag_intro">Introduction to SelectionDAGs</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>
The SelectionDAG provides an abstraction for code representation in a way that 
is amenable to instruction selection using automatic techniques
(e.g. dynamic-programming based optimal pattern matching selectors), It is also
well suited to other phases of code generation; in particular,
instruction scheduling (SelectionDAG's are very close to scheduling DAGs
post-selection).  Additionally, the SelectionDAG provides a host representation
where a large variety of very-low-level (but target-independent) 
<a href="#selectiondag_optimize">optimizations</a> may be
performed: ones which require extensive information about the instructions
efficiently supported by the target.
</p>

<p>
The SelectionDAG is a Directed-Acyclic-Graph whose nodes are instances of the
<tt>SDNode</tt> class.  The primary payload of the <tt>SDNode</tt> is its 
operation code (Opcode) that indicates what operation the node performs and
the operands to the operation.
The various operation node types are described at the top of the
<tt>include/llvm/CodeGen/SelectionDAGNodes.h</tt> file.</p>

<p>Although most operations define a single value, each node in the graph may 
define multiple values.  For example, a combined div/rem operation will define
both the dividend and the remainder. Many other situations require multiple
values as well.  Each node also has some number of operands, which are edges 
to the node defining the used value.  Because nodes may define multiple values,
edges are represented by instances of the <tt>SDOperand</tt> class, which is 
a &lt;SDNode, unsigned&gt; pair, indicating the node and result
value being used, respectively.  Each value produced by an SDNode has an 
associated MVT::ValueType, indicating what type the value is.
</p>

<p>
SelectionDAGs contain two different kinds of values: those that represent data
flow and those that represent control flow dependencies.  Data values are simple
edges with an integer or floating point value type.  Control edges are
represented as "chain" edges which are of type MVT::Other.  These edges provide
an ordering between nodes that have side effects (such as
loads/stores/calls/return/etc).  All nodes that have side effects should take a
token chain as input and produce a new one as output.  By convention, token
chain inputs are always operand #0, and chain results are always the last
value produced by an operation.</p>

<p>
A SelectionDAG has designated "Entry" and "Root" nodes.  The Entry node is
always a marker node with an Opcode of ISD::EntryToken.  The Root node is the
final side-effecting node in the token chain. For example, in a single basic
block function, this would be the return node.
</p>

<p>
One important concept for SelectionDAGs is the notion of a "legal" vs. "illegal"
DAG.  A legal DAG for a target is one that only uses supported operations and
supported types.  On a 32-bit PowerPC, for example, a DAG with any values of i1,
i8, i16,
or i64 type would be illegal, as would a DAG that uses a SREM or UREM operation.
The <a href="#selectiondag_legalize">legalize</a>
phase is responsible for turning an illegal DAG into a legal DAG.
</p>
</div>

<div class="doc_subsubsection">
  <a name="selectiondag_process">SelectionDAG Instruction Selection Process</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>
SelectionDAG-based instruction selection consists of the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#selectiondag_build">Build initial DAG</a> - This stage performs
    a simple translation from the input LLVM code to an illegal SelectionDAG.
    </li>
<li><a href="#selectiondag_optimize">Optimize SelectionDAG</a> - This stage
    performs simple optimizations on the SelectionDAG to simplify it and
    recognize meta instructions (like rotates and div/rem pairs) for
    targets that support these meta operations.  This makes the resultant code
    more efficient and the 'select instructions from DAG' phase (below) simpler.
</li>
<li><a href="#selectiondag_legalize">Legalize SelectionDAG</a> - This stage
    converts the illegal SelectionDAG to a legal SelectionDAG, by eliminating
    unsupported operations and data types.</li>
<li><a href="#selectiondag_optimize">Optimize SelectionDAG (#2)</a> - This
    second run of the SelectionDAG optimized the newly legalized DAG, to
    eliminate inefficiencies introduced by legalization.</li>
<li><a href="#selectiondag_select">Select instructions from DAG</a> - Finally,
    the target instruction selector matches the DAG operations to target
    instructions.  This process translates the target-independent input DAG into
    another DAG of target instructions.</li>
<li><a href="#selectiondag_sched">SelectionDAG Scheduling and Formation</a>
    - The last phase assigns a linear order to the instructions in the 
    target-instruction DAG and emits them into the MachineFunction being
    compiled.  This step uses traditional prepass scheduling techniques.</li>
</ol>

<p>After all of these steps are complete, the SelectionDAG is destroyed and the
rest of the code generation passes are run.</p>

<p>One great way to visualize what is going on here is to take advantage of a 
few LLC command line options.  In particular, the <tt>-view-isel-dags</tt>
option pops up a window with the SelectionDAG input to the Select phase for all
of the code compiled (if you only get errors printed to the console while using
this, you probably <a href="ProgrammersManual.html#ViewGraph">need to configure
your system</a> to add support for it).  The <tt>-view-sched-dags</tt> option
views the SelectionDAG output from the Select phase and input to the Scheduler
phase.

The initial SelectionDAG is naively peephole expanded from the LLVM input by
the <tt>SelectionDAGLowering</tt> class in the SelectionDAGISel.cpp file.  The 
intent of  this pass is to expose as much low-level, target-specific details 
to the SelectionDAG as possible.  This pass is mostly hard-coded (e.g. an LLVM 
add turns into an SDNode add while a geteelementptr is expanded into the obvious
arithmetic). This pass requires target-specific hooks to lower calls and
returns, varargs, etc.  For these features, the <a

used.

<div class="doc_subsubsection">
  <a name="selectiondag_legalize">SelectionDAG Legalize Phase</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The Legalize phase is in charge of converting a DAG to only use the types and
operations that are natively supported by the target.  This involves two major
tasks:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Convert values of unsupported types to values of supported types.</p>
    <p>There are two main ways of doing this: converting small types to 
       larger types ("promoting"), and breaking up large integer types
       into smaller ones ("expanding").  For example, a target might require
       that all f32 values are promoted to f64 and that all i1/i8/i16 values
       are promoted to i32.  The same target might require that all i64 values
       be expanded into i32 values.  These changes can insert sign and zero
       extensions as 
       needed to make sure that the final code has the same behavior as the 
       input.</p>
    <p>A target implementation tells the legalizer which types are supported
       (and which register class to use for them) by calling the
       "addRegisterClass" method in its TargetLowering constructor.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Eliminate operations that are not supported by the target.</p>
    <p>Targets often have weird constraints, such as not supporting every
       operation on every supported datatype (e.g. X86 does not support byte
       conditional moves and PowerPC does not support sign-extending loads from
       a 16-bit memory location).  Legalize takes care by open-coding
       another sequence of operations to emulate the operation ("expansion"), by
       promoting to a larger type that supports the operation
       (promotion), or using a target-specific hook to implement the
       legalization (custom).</p>
    <p>A target implementation tells the legalizer which operations are not
       supported (and which of the above three actions to take) by calling the
       "setOperationAction" method in its TargetLowering constructor.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Prior to the existance of the Legalize pass, we required that every
target <a href="#selectiondag_optimize">selector</a> supported and handled every
operator and type even if they are not natively supported.  The introduction of
the Legalize phase allows all of the 
cannonicalization patterns to be shared across targets, and makes it very 
easy to optimize the cannonicalized code because it is still in the form of 
a DAG.

  <a name="selectiondag_optimize">SelectionDAG Optimization Phase: the DAG
  Combiner</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>
The SelectionDAG optimization phase is run twice for code generation: once
immediately after the DAG is built and once after legalization.  The first run
of the pass allows the initial code to be cleaned up (e.g. performing 
optimizations that depend on knowing that the operators have restricted type 
inputs).  The second run of the pass cleans up the messy code generated by the 
Legalize pass, which allows Legalize to be very simple (it can focus on making
code legal instead of focusing on generating <i>good</i> and legal code).
</p>

<p>
One important class of optimizations performed is optimizing inserted sign and
zero extension instructions.  We currently use ad-hoc techniques, but could move
to more rigorous techniques in the future.  Here are some good

<div class="doc_subsubsection">
  <a name="selectiondag_select">SelectionDAG Select Phase</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The Select phase is the bulk of the target-specific code for instruction
selection.  This phase takes a legal SelectionDAG as input,
pattern matches the instructions supported by the target to this DAG, and
produces a new DAG of target code.  For example, consider the following LLVM
fragment:</p>

<pre>
   %t1 = add float %W, %X
   %t2 = mul float %t1, %Y
   %t3 = add float %t2, %Z
</pre>

<p>This LLVM code corresponds to a SelectionDAG that looks basically like this:
</p>

<pre>
  (fadd:f32 (fmul:f32 (fadd:f32 W, X), Y), Z)
</pre>

<p>If a target supports floating pointer multiple-and-add (FMA) operations, one
of the adds can be merged with the multiply.  On the PowerPC, for example, the
output of the instruction selector might look like this DAG:</p>

<pre>
  (FMADDS (FADDS W, X), Y, Z)
</pre>

<p>
The FMADDS instruction is a ternary instruction that multiplies its first two
operands and adds the third (as single-precision floating-point numbers).  The
FADDS instruction is a simple binary single-precision add instruction.  To
perform this pattern match, the PowerPC backend includes the following
instruction definitions:
</p>

<pre>
def FMADDS : AForm_1&lt;59, 29,
                    (ops F4RC:$FRT, F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRC, F4RC:$FRB),
                    "fmadds $FRT, $FRA, $FRC, $FRB",
                    [<b>(set F4RC:$FRT, (fadd (fmul F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRC),
                                           F4RC:$FRB))</b>]&gt;;
def FADDS : AForm_2&lt;59, 21,
                    (ops F4RC:$FRT, F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRB),
                    "fadds $FRT, $FRA, $FRB",
                    [<b>(set F4RC:$FRT, (fadd F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRB))</b>]&gt;;
</pre>

<p>The portion of the instruction definition in bold indicates the pattern used
to match the instruction.  The DAG operators (like <tt>fmul</tt>/<tt>fadd</tt>)
are defined in the <tt>lib/Target/TargetSelectionDAG.td</tt> file.  
"<tt>F4RC</tt>" is the register class of the input and result values.<p>

<p>The TableGen DAG instruction selector generator reads the instruction 
patterns in the .td and automatically builds parts of the pattern matching code
for your target.  It has the following strengths:</p>

<ul>
<li>At compiler-compiler time, it analyzes your instruction patterns and tells
    you if things are legal or not.</li>
<li>It can handle arbitrary constraints on operands for the pattern match.  In
    particular, it is straight forward to say things like "match any immediate
    that is a 13-bit sign-extended value".  For examples, see the 
    <tt>immSExt16</tt> and related tblgen classes in the PowerPC backend.</li>
<li>It knows several important identities for the patterns defined.  For
    example, it knows that addition is commutative, so it allows the 
    <tt>FMADDS</tt> pattern above to match "<tt>(fadd X, (fmul Y, Z))</tt>" as
    well as "<tt>(fadd (fmul X, Y), Z)</tt>", without the target author having
    to specially handle this case.</li>
<li>It has a full strength type-inferencing system.  In particular, you should
    rarely have to explicitly tell the system what type parts of your patterns
    are.  In the FMADDS case above, we didn't have to tell tblgen that all of
    the nodes in the pattern are of type 'f32'.  It was able to infer and
    propagate this knowledge from the fact that F4RC has type 'f32'.</li>
<li>Targets can define their own (and rely on built-in) "pattern fragments".
    Pattern fragments are chunks of reusable patterns that get inlined into your
    patterns during compiler-compiler time.  For example, the integer "(not x)"
    operation is actually defined as a pattern fragment that expands as
    "(xor x, -1)", since the SelectionDAG does not have a native 'not'
    operation.  Targets can define their own short-hand fragments as they see
    fit.  See the definition of 'not' and 'ineg' for examples.</li>
<li>In addition to instructions, targets can specify arbitrary patterns that
    map to one or more instructions, using the 'Pat' definition.  For example,
    the PowerPC has no way of loading an arbitrary integer immediate into a
    register in one instruction. To tell tblgen how to do this, it defines:
    
    <pre>
    // Arbitrary immediate support.  Implement in terms of LIS/ORI.
    def : Pat&lt;(i32 imm:$imm),
              (ORI (LIS (HI16 imm:$imm)), (LO16 imm:$imm))&gt;;
    </pre>
    
    If none of the single-instruction patterns for loading an immediate into a
    register match, this will be used.  This rule says "match an arbitrary i32
    immediate, turning it into an ORI ('or a 16-bit immediate') and an LIS
    ('load 16-bit immediate, where the immediate is shifted to the left 16
    bits') instruction".  To make this work, the LO16/HI16 node transformations
    are used to manipulate the input immediate (in this case, take the high or
    low 16-bits of the immediate).
    </li>
<li>While the system does automate a lot, it still allows you to write custom
    C++ code to match special cases, in case there is something that is hard
    to express.</li>
</ul>

<p>
While it has many strengths, the system currently has some limitations,
primarily because it is a work in progress and is not yet finished:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Overall, there is no way to define or match SelectionDAG nodes that define
    multiple values (e.g. ADD_PARTS, LOAD, CALL, etc).  This is the biggest
    reason that you currently still <i>have to</i> write custom C++ code for
    your instruction selector.</li>
<li>There is no great way to support match complex addressing modes yet.  In the
    future, we will extend pattern fragments to allow them to define multiple
    values (e.g. the four operands of the <a href="#x86_memory">X86 addressing
    mode</a>).  In addition, we'll extend fragments so that a fragment can match
    multiple different patterns.</li>
<li>We don't automatically infer flags like isStore/isLoad yet.</li>
<li>We don't automatically generate the set of supported registers and
    operations for the <a href="#"selectiondag_legalize>Legalizer</a> yet.</li>
<li>We don't have a way of tying in custom legalized nodes yet.</li>
</li>

<p>Despite these limitations, the instruction selector generator is still quite
useful for most of the binary and logical operations in typical instruction
sets.  If you run into any problems or can't figure out how to do something, 
please let Chris know!</p>
