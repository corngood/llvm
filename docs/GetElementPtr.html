  <p>This document seeks to dispel the mystery and confusion surrounding LLVM's
  GetElementPtr (GEP) instruction. Questions about the wiley GEP instruction are
  probably the most frequently occuring questions once a developer gets down to
  coding with LLVM. Here we lay out the sources of confusion and show that the
  GEP instruction is really quite simple.

  <p>When people are first confronted with the GEP instruction, they tend to
  relate it to known concepts from other programming paradigms, most notably C
  array indexing and field selection. However, GEP is a little different and
  this leads to the following questions, all of which are answered in the
  following sections.</p>

  <a name="firstptr"><b>What is the first index of the GEP instruction?</b></a>
</div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>Quick answer: The index stepping through the first operand.</p> 
  <p>The confusion with the first index usually arises from thinking about 
  the GetElementPtr instruction as if it was a C index operator. They aren't the
  same. For example, when we write, in "C":</p>
  <pre>
  AType* Foo;
  ...
  X = &amp;Foo-&gt;F;</pre>
  <p>it is natural to think that there is only one index, the selection of the
  field <tt>F</tt>.  However, in this example, <tt>Foo</tt> is a pointer. That 
  pointer must be indexed explicitly in LLVM. C, on the other hand, indexs
  through it transparently.  To arrive at the same address location as the C 
  code, you would provide the GEP instruction with two index operands. The 
  first operand indexes through the pointer; the second operand indexes the 
  field <tt>F</tt> of the structure, just as if you wrote:</p>
  <pre>
  X = &amp;Foo[0].F;</pre>
  <p>Sometimes this question gets rephrased as:</p>
  <blockquote><i>Why is it okay to index through the first pointer, but 
      subsequent pointers won't be dereferenced?</i></blockquote> 
  <p>The answer is simply because memory does not have to be accessed to 
  perform the computation. The first operand to the GEP instruction must be a 
  value of a pointer type. The value of the pointer is provided directly to 
  the GEP instruction as an operand without any need for accessing memory. It 
  must, therefore be indexed and requires an index operand. Consider this 
  example:</p>
  <pre>
  struct munger_struct {
    int f1;
    int f2;
  };
  void munge(struct munger_struct *P)
  {
    P[0].f1 = P[1].f1 + P[2].f2;
  }
  ...
  munger_struct Array[3];
  ...
  munge(Array);</pre>
  <p>In this "C" example, the front end compiler (llvm-gcc) will generate three
  GEP instructions for the three indices through "P" in the assignment
  statement.  The function argument <tt>P</tt> will be the first operand of each
  of these GEP instructions.  The second operand will be the field offset into
  the <tt>struct munger_struct</tt> type,  for either the <tt>f1</tt> or 
  <tt>f2</tt> field. So, in LLVM assembly the <tt>munge</tt> function looks 
  like:</p>
  <pre>
  void %munge(%struct.munger_struct* %P) {
  entry:
    %tmp = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct* %P, int 1, uint 0
    %tmp = load int* %tmp
    %tmp6 = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct* %P, int 2, uint 1
    %tmp7 = load int* %tmp6
    %tmp8 = add int %tmp7, %tmp
    %tmp9 = getelementptr %struct.munger_struct* %P, int 0, uint 0
    store int %tmp8, int* %tmp9
    ret void
  }</pre>
  <p>In each case the first operand is the pointer through which the GEP
  instruction starts. The same is true whether the first operand is an
  argument, allocated memory, or a global variable. </p>
  <p>To make this clear, let's consider a more obtuse example:</p>
  <pre>
  %MyVar = unintialized global int
  ...
  %idx1 = getelementptr int* %MyVar, long 0
  %idx2 = getelementptr int* %MyVar, long 1
  %idx3 = getelementptr int* %MyVar, long 2</pre>
  <p>These GEP instructions are simply making address computations from the 
  base address of <tt>MyVar</tt>.  They compute, as follows (using C syntax):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> idx1 = (char*) &amp;MyVar + 0</li>
    <li> idx2 = (char*) &amp;MyVar + 4</li>
    <li> idx3 = (char*) &amp;MyVar + 8</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Since the type <tt>int</tt> is known to be four bytes long, the indices 
  0, 1 and 2 translate into memory offsets of 0, 4, and 8, respectively. No 
  memory is accessed to make these computations because the address of 
  <tt>%MyVar</tt> is passed directly to the GEP instructions.</p>
  <p>The obtuse part of this example is in the cases of <tt>%idx2</tt> and 
  <tt>%idx3</tt>. They result in the computation of addresses that point to
  memory past the end of the <tt>%MyVar</tt> global, which is only one
  <tt>int</tt> long, not three <tt>int</tt>s long.  While this is legal in LLVM,
  it is inadvisable because any load or store with the pointer that results 
  from these GEP instructions would produce undefined results.</p>

  <a name="extra_index"><b>Why is the extra 0 index required?</b></a>
</div>
<!-- *********************************************************************** -->
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>Quick answer: there are no superfluous indices.</p>
  <p>This question arises most often when the GEP instruction is applied to a
  global variable which is always a pointer type. For example, consider
  this:</p><pre>
  %MyStruct = uninitialized global { float*, int }
  ...
  %idx = getelementptr { float*, int }* %MyStruct, long 0, ubyte 1</pre>
  <p>The GEP above yields an <tt>int*</tt> by indexing the <tt>int</tt> typed 
  field of the structure <tt>%MyStruct</tt>. When people first look at it, they 
  wonder why the <tt>long 0</tt> index is needed. However, a closer inspection 
  of how globals and GEPs work reveals the need. Becoming aware of the following
  facts will dispell the confusion:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The type of <tt>%MyStruct</tt> is <i>not</i> <tt>{ float*, int }</tt> 
    but rather <tt>{ float*, int }*</tt>. That is, <tt>%MyStruct</tt> is a 
    pointer to a structure containing a pointer to a <tt>float</tt> and an 
    <tt>int</tt>.</li>
    <li>Point #1 is evidenced by noticing the type of the first operand of 
    the GEP instruction (<tt>%MyStruct</tt>) which is 
    <tt>{ float*, int }*</tt>.</li>
    <li>The first index, <tt>long 0</tt> is required to step over the global
    variable <tt>%MyStruct</tt>.  Since the first argument to the GEP
    instruction must always be a value of pointer type, the first index 
    steps through that pointer. A value of 0 means 0 elements offset from that
    pointer.</li>
    <li>The second index, <tt>ubyte 1</tt> selects the second field of the
    structure (the <tt>int</tt>). </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->
<div class="doc_subsection">
  <a name="deref"><b>What is dereferenced by GEP?</b></a>
</div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>Quick answer: nothing.</p> 
  <p>The GetElementPtr instruction dereferences nothing. That is, it doesn't
  access memory in any way. That's what the Load and Store instructions are for.
  GEP is only involved in the computation of addresses. For example, consider 
  this:</p>
  <pre>
  %MyVar = uninitialized global { [40 x int ]* }
  ...
  %idx = getelementptr { [40 x int]* }* %MyVar, long 0, ubyte 0, long 0, long 17</pre>
  <p>In this example, we have a global variable, <tt>%MyVar</tt> that is a
  pointer to a structure containing a pointer to an array of 40 ints. The 
  GEP instruction seems to be accessing the 18th integer of the structure's
  array of ints. However, this is actually an illegal GEP instruction. It 
  won't compile. The reason is that the pointer in the structure <i>must</i>
  be dereferenced in order to index into the array of 40 ints. Since the 
  GEP instruction never accesses memory, it is illegal.</p>
  <p>In order to access the 18th integer in the array, you would need to do the
  following:</p>
  <pre>
  %idx = getelementptr { [40 x int]* }* %, long 0, ubyte 0
  %arr = load [40 x int]** %idx
  %idx = getelementptr [40 x int]* %arr, long 0, long 17</pre>
  <p>In this case, we have to load the pointer in the structure with a load
  instruction before we can index into the array. If the example was changed 
  to:</p>
  <pre>
  %MyVar = uninitialized global { [40 x int ] }
  ...
  %idx = getelementptr { [40 x int] }*, long 0, ubyte 0, long 17</pre>
  <p>then everything works fine. In this case, the structure does not contain a
  pointer and the GEP instruction can index through the global variable,
  into the first field of the structure and access the 18th <tt>int</tt> in the 
  array there.</p>

<div class="doc_subsection">
  <a name="lead0"><b>Why don't GEP x,0,0,1 and GEP x,1 alias?</b></a>
</div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>Quick Answer: They compute different address locations.</p>
  <p>If you look at the first indices in these GEP
  instructions you find that they are different (0 and 1), therefore the address
  computation diverges with that index. Consider this example:</p>
  <pre>
  %MyVar = global { [10 x int ] }
  %idx1 = getlementptr { [10 x int ] }* %MyVar, long 0, ubyte 0, long 1
  %idx2 = getlementptr { [10 x int ] }* %MyVar, long 1</pre>
  <p>In this example, <tt>idx1</tt> computes the address of the second integer
  in the array that is in the structure in %MyVar, that is <tt>MyVar+4</tt>. The 
  type of <tt>idx1</tt> is <tt>int*</tt>. However, <tt>idx2</tt> computes the 
  address of <i>the next</i> structure after <tt>%MyVar</tt>. The type of 
  <tt>idx2</tt> is <tt>{ [10 x int] }*</tt> and its value is equivalent 
  to <tt>MyVar + 40</tt> because it indexes past the ten 4-byte integers 
  in <tt>MyVar</tt>. Obviously, in such a situation, the pointers don't 
  alias.</p>
</div>

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->
<div class="doc_subsection">
  <a name="trail0"><b>Why do GEP x,1,0,0 and GEP x,1 alias?</b></a>
</div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>Quick Answer: They compute the same address location.</p>
  <p>These two GEP instructions will compute the same address because indexing
  through the 0th element does not change the address. However, it does change
  the type. Consider this example:</p>
  <pre>
  %MyVar = global { [10 x int ] }
  %idx1 = getlementptr { [10 x int ] }* %MyVar, long 1, ubyte 0, long 0
  %idx2 = getlementptr { [10 x int ] }* %MyVar, long 1</pre>
  <p>In this example, the value of <tt>%idx1</tt> is <tt>%MyVar+40</tt> and
  its type is <tt>int*</tt>. The value of <tt>%idx2</tt> is also 
  <tt>MyVar+40</tt> but its type is <tt>{ [10 x int] }*</tt>.</p>

  <p>In summary, here's some things to always remember about the GetElementPtr

    <li>The GEP instruction never accesses memory, it only provides pointer

    <li>The first operand to the GEP instruction is always a pointer and it must

    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>why?</td></tr>

    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>Yorion: Consider: struct *P </td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>P-&gt;X  == P[0].X</td></tr>

    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>P-&gt;X-&gt;Y == P[0].X[0].Y</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>Not P.X.Y</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>actually that's a bad analogy</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>because C dereferences in this case</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>Try: (&amp;(P-&gt;X))-&gt;Y</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>so, a=GEP x,1,0; b=GEP a,1,0; c=GEP b,1,0, can you construct the definition of c in terms of x?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>yes, but you're going out of bounds :)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>consider this:</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>{ float, { double , { int } } } *P</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>int *X = gep P, 0, 1, 1, 0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>do you understand the leading zero?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>alternatively:</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>sabre: shouldn't the type be: { float, { double, { int }* } }* P ?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>nope</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>why the extra * ?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>if it helps, the type of t is { double, {int}}* and  t2 is {int}* and X is int*</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>wait... 0 represents dereference, natural number i
        represents &amp;A[i] ?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>gep does no dereferences, ever</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>gep P, 0, 1  is equivalent to &amp;P[0].X</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>aka &amp;P-&gt;X</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>gep P, 1  == &amp;P[1]  aka P+1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>so gep P, 0, 1 can't alias gep P, 1  just like
        &amp;P-&gt;Y can't alias P+1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>assuming P is a pointer to struct {X, Y }</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>sabre: is it possible to come up with a general rule for "arithmetic of GEP indices"? </td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>Yorion: of course, it's very simple</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>just not what you're expecting :)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>See langref.html</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>for example,  a=GEP x,0,0,1 b=GEP a,0,0,1, c=GEP b,0,0,1, that should be equal to GEP x,0,1,1,0, right?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>I did</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>oops, equal to GEP x,0,1,1,1,0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>that would be:</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>GEP X, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>you're killing me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>The basic rule when turning: A = GEP B, C    D = GEP A, 0, E</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>is that you drop the 0, turning it into</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>GEP B, C, E</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>okay, that's good. any other rules?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>nicholas</td><td>what if it isn't a 0?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>more generally: A = GEP Ptr, B, C, ...   D = GEP A, 0, E, F, ... </td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>D = GEP Ptr, B, C, ... E, F, ...</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>if it's not zero, you generally cannot concatenate them</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>unless the first gep has one subscript</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>in which case you drop the zero</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>if you look in InstCombiner::visitGetElementPtrInst, it should have this logic</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>what if there is no zero? how can I compute the offset from the base pointer in that case?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>like A=GEP B,C   and D=GEP A,E,F</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>you don't have to combine them to compute an offset</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>are you *just* trying to get a byte offset from the pointer?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>I'm trying to get offset of D from B</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>why didn't you say so? :)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>with all constant subscripts, it's trivial</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>look at SelectionDAGLowering::visitGetElementPtr</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>in CodeGen/SelectionDAG/SelectionDAGISel.cpp</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>basically the rule is that you multiply the index by the size of the thing indexed</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>there is also a Support/GetElementPtrIterator or something</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>that makes it trivial to see what type is indexed by which subscript</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>for each subscript it gives you a type</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>For an array subscript you multiply the index by the indexed type</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>for a struct subscript, you add the field offset</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>s/array/sequentialtype/ if you're in a pedantic mood</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>let's focus on structs: in that case, the above given example would be: D = GEP B,C,E,F?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>no</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>you drop the E if it's zero</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>if it's not you can't concat</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>are you trying to trick me into saying "yes, just append the indices"? :)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>okay, let's assume E is not zero, how do I compute offset from B for D for a struct?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>Why are you framing this in terms of concatenation?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>no, I'm trying to understand it</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>computing an offset and concatenating are entirely different</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>Lets consider a specific example</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>because I want to express certain properties in the terms of base pointers either globals or parameters</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>I want to eliminate locals from my analysis</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>you realize that parmeters can point into the middle of structs?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>you realize invalid access paths can be constructed with geps/</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>what do you mean by invalid access paths? </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>like offseting out of the struct which is passed to the function?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>The case where the subscript isn't zero is invalid code</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>from a type-safety perspective</td></tr>
    <tr><td>DannyB</td><td>he means untypesafe things that seem valid :)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>DannyB</td><td>IE they point somewhere in the struct, but not to any particular field</td></tr>
    <tr><td>DannyB</td><td>(or whatever)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>right</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>okay</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>or they might point in some other struct :)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>It's the equivalent to saying:</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>struct Foo { int A, int B; }</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>Foo* P = </td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>T = &amp;P-&gt;B;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>S = T+1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>that is:</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>T = gep 0, 1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>S = gep T, 1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>you can't concat those and get a type-safe access path</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>remember T = &amp;P-&gt;B  === T = &amp;P[0].B</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>understand?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>let me think for a minute</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>Consider what the C case does, it will be most clear if you're used to C</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>:)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>Consider the byte offset and why it doesn't point into P-&gt; anything</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>it points into P[1] not P[0]</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>it's perfectly fine if GEP offsets out of the type. I'd still need to express GEP in the terms of base pointers. Take the example above: T=GEP P,0,1; S=GEP T,1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>type safety is not crucial in my case</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>That specific example is GEP P, 1, 0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>however, you can form geps that are NOT equivalent to anything else</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>for example, consider:</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>struct X { int, char}</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>that is fine. they're equivalent to something in the calling context</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>the same sequence points into padding</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>and there is no gep that can do that</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>the bottom line is: if the program is valid, interprocedural analysis will match that offset with something in one of the functions on the call stack</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>and that's all I care about</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>can you give me a formula for structs for computing
        offsets that takes into account the case GEP T,&amp;lt:non_zeros&gt; and the size of the structs/fields?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>yes, I did above</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>Two things:</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>GEP Ptr, A, X, Y, Z</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>The result is Ptr + A * sizeof(struct) + fieldoffs(X) + fieldoffs(Y) + fieldoffs(Z)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>simple enough?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>you see why "A" is special?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>give me a min, I'm constructing an example</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Reid</td><td>sabre: I think I finally understand</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Reid</td><td>your comment that GEP *never* dereferences makes a lot of sense</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Reid</td><td>it is only doing address calculation, so the first one is taking the address of the var</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>If C didn't conflate lvalues and rvalues, GEP would be much easier to understand for people</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Reid</td><td>yeah</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>so, for example: M=GEP A,B,C; N=GEP M,D,E;   N = [ A + B*sizeof(struct) + fieldoffs(C) ]:(of type T) + D*sizeof(T) + fieldoffs(E)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Reid</td><td>I just remember learning a hard lesson about the difference between char* A and char A[] .. long time ago when I was learning C</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>of type T*</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>otherwise fine</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>okay, I think I finally understand it</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>without the T* your D sizeof will be wrong</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>a suggestion: the formula you gave above explains it all</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>I'd suggest explaining it that way in documentation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>That's not right though</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>it doesn't include arrays or packed types</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>so it is, at best, a half truth</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>tell me, how to compute the fieldoffs for an index?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>arrays can be in structs :)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>in bytes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>idx * sizeof(arrayelt)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>just like for pointers (the first index)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>There are two cases: structs and sequentials</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>for sequentials you use idx*sizeof(sequenced type)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>for structs you add their offset</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>it's really very simple :)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>the first index of a gep is always over the pointer</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>no I meant in LLVM, how do I convert the field offset into bytes?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>which is why it's strange</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>if you only think about structs</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>TargetData::getFieldOffset </td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>or something</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>look in SelectionDAGISel.cpp (visitGEP) as I suggested.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>do you still have the energy to go over sequential types? :-)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>what is the offset formula for sequential types?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Reid</td><td>we just went over that: idx * sizeof(elementType)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>so, if there's an array hidden somewhere in the struct, essentially I need to compute idx*sizeof() instead of fieldoffs() and that's it?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Reid</td><td>yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>excellent.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>There are two cases: structs and sequentials</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>[9:17pm] sabre: for sequentials you use idx*sizeof(sequenced type)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>[9:17pm] sabre: for structs you add their offset</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sabre</td><td>[9:17pm] sabre: it's really very simple :)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>now when I understand it, it is simple... </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yorion</td><td>thx</td></tr>
