<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>This document contains the LLVM Developer Policy which defines the
  project's policy towards developers and their contributions. The intent of 
  this policy is to eliminate mis-communication, rework, and confusion that 
  might arise from the distributed nature of LLVM's development.  By stating 
  the policy in clear terms, we hope each developer can know ahead of time
  what to expect when making LLVM contributions.</p>
  <p>This policy is also designed to accomplish the following objectives:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Attract both users and developers to the LLVM project.</li>
    <li>Make life as simple and easy for contributors as possible.</li>
    <li>Indicate that LLVM is a mature project with a thriving community and
    sensible policies directing its ongoing development.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_section"><a name="general">General Policies</a></div>
<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>This section contains policies that pertain generally to LLVM developers. 
  LLVM Developers are expected to meet the following obligations in order 
  for LLVM to maintain a high standard of quality.<p>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="informed">Stay Informed</a> </div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>Developers should stay informed by reading at least the 
  <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">llvmdev</a> 
  email list.  If you are doing anything more than just casual work on LLVM, 
  it is suggested that you also subscribe to the 
  <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvm-commits">llvm-commits</a> 
  list and pay attention to changes being made by others.</p>
  <p>We recommend that active developers register an email account with 
  <a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/">LLVM Bugzilla</a> and preferably subscribe to
  the <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmbugs">llvm-bugs</a>
  email list to keep track of bugs and enhancements occurring in LLVM.</p>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="newwork">Starting New Work</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>When a developer begins a major new project with the aim of contributing 
  it back to LLVM, s/he should inform the community with an email to 
  the <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">llvm-dev</a> 
  email list, to the extent possible. The reason for this is to:
  <ul>
    <li>keep the community informed about future changes to LLVM, </li>
    <li>avoid duplication of effort by having multiple parties working on the
    same thing and not knowing about it, and</li>
    <li>ensure that any technical issues around the proposed work are 
    discussed and resolved before any significant work is done.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The design of LLVM is carefully controlled to ensure that all the pieces
  fit together well. If you plan to make a major change to the way LLVM works or
  a major new extension, it is a good idea to get consensus with the development
  community before you start working on it.</p>
</div>
</td></tr></table>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="reviews">Code Reviews</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>LLVM has a code review policy. Code review is an excellent way to ensure
  high quality in the software. The following policies apply:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>All developers are required to have significant changes reviewed 
    before they are committed to the repository.</li>
    <li>Code reviews are conducted by email.</li>
    <li>Code can be reviewed either before it is committed or after.</li>
    <li>The developer responsible for a code change is also responsible for
    making all necessary review changes.</li>
    <li>Developers should participate in code reviews as both a reviewer and 
    a reviewee. We don't have a dedicated team of reviewers. If someone is
    kind enough to review your code, you should return the favor for someone 
    else.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="incremental">Incremental Development</a>
</div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>LLVM uses an incremental development style and all developers are expected
  to follow this practice. Incremental development is a big key to LLVM's
  success and it is essential that developers submit incremental patches. The
  following defines the incremental development approach:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The first task is to define the increment and get consensus (with the
    LLVM development community) on what the end goal of the change is. Making 
    random small changes that go nowhere is not useful for anyone.</li>
    <li>An increment is the smallest patch size necessary to effect one change 
    in LLVM.</li>
    <li>Increments can be stand alone (e.g. to fix a bug), or part of a planned
    series of increments towards some development goal.</li>
    <li>Increments should be kept as small as possible. This simplifies your 
    work (into a logical progression), simplifies code review and reduces the
    chance that you will get negative feedback on the change. Small increments
    also facilitate the maintenance of a high quality code base.</li>
    <li>Larger increments require a larger testing effort.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="quality">Quality</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>The minimum quality standards for any change to the main development 
  branch are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Code must adhere to the 
    <a href="CodingStandards.html">LLVM Coding Standards</a>.</li>
    <li>Code must compile cleanly (no errors, no warnings) on at least one 
    platform.</li>
    <li>Code must pass the deja gnu (llvm/test) test suite.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Additionally, the committer is responsible for addressing all of the 
  following items (preferably before submission):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The code should compile cleanly on all platforms.</li>
    <li>The changes should not cause regressions in the <tt>llvm-test</tt>
    suite including SPEC CINT2000, SPEC CFP2000, SPEC CINT2006, and 
    SPEC CFP2006.</li>
    <li>The change set should not cause performance or correctness regressions 
    for the LLVM tools.</li>
    <li>The changes should not cause performance or correctness regressions in 
    code compiled by LLVM on all applicable targets.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="testcases">Test Cases</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>Developers are required to create test cases for regressions and new
  features and include them with their changes. The following policies
  apply:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>All feature and regression test cases must be added to the 
    <tt>llvm/test</tt> directory. The appropriate sub-directory should be 
    selected (see the <a href="TestingGuide.html">Testing Guide</a> for 
    details).</li>
    <li>Test cases should be written in 
    <a href="LangRef.html">LLVM assembly language</a> unless the
    feature or regression being tested requires another language (e.g. the
    bug being fixed or feature being implemented is in the lvm-gcc C++
    front-end).</li>
    <li>Test cases, especially for regressions, should be reduced as much as 
    possible, by <a href="CommandGuide/html/bugpoint.html">bugpoint</a> or
    manually. It is unacceptable 
    to place an entire failing program into <tt>llvm/test</tt> as this creates
    a <i>time-to-test</i> burden on all developers. Please keep them short.</li>
    <li>More extensive test cases (applications, benchmarks, etc.) should be 
    added to the <tt>llvm-test</tt> test suite.  This test suite is for 
    coverage not features or regressions.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_section"><a name="patches">Patch Policies</a></div>
<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>This section contains policies that pertain to submitting patches 
  to LLVM and committing code to the repository</p>
</div>
<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="p_form">Patch Form</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>When submitting a patch, developers must follow these rules:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Patches must be made against the CVS HEAD (main development trunk), 
    not a branch.</li>
    <li>Patches should be made with this command:<pre>
    cvs diff -Ntdup -5</pre> or with the utility <tt>utils/mkpatch</tt>.</li>
    <li>Patches should not include differences in generated code such as the
    code generated by <tt>flex</tt>, <tt>bison</tt> or <tt>tblgen</tt>. The
    <tt>utils/mkpatch</tt> utility takes care of this for you.</li>
    <li>Patches must not include any patent violations. To the best of our
    knowledge, LLVM is free of any existing patent violations and it is our 
    intent to keep it that way. </li>
  </ol>
</div>
<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="p_testing">Patch Testing</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>Before a patch is submitted for review, it should be tested to ensure 
  that:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The patch must compile against the CVS HEAD cleanly (zero warnings, zero
    errors).</li>
    <li>All the llvm/test (Deja Gnu) tests must pass.</li>
    <li>The patch should cause no regressions in the llvm-test test suite. How
    much testing is appropriate depends on the nature of the patch. We leave it
    to your good judgement, but you will be responsible for fixing any
    regressions or reverting the patch.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="p_submission">Patch Submission</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>When a patch is ready to be submitted, these policies apply:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Patches should be submitted immediately after they are generated. Stale
    patches may not apply correctly if the underlying code changes between the
    time the patch was created and the time it is applied.</li>
    <li>Patches should be submitted by e-mail to the 
    <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvm-commits">
      llvm-commits</a> list.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="p_aftersub">After Submission</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>After a patch has been submitted, these policies apply:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The patch is subject to review by anyone on the  
    <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvm-commits">llvm-commits</a>
    email list.</li>
    <li>Changes recommended by a reviewer should be incorporated into your
    patch or you should explain why the reviewer is incorrect. 
    <li>Changes to the patch must be re-submitted to the 
    <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvm-commits">llvm-commits</a>
    email list.</li>
    <li>This process iterates until all review issues have been addressed.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="p_aftercommit">After Commit</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>After a patch has been committed, these policies apply:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The patch is subject to further review by anyone on the llvm-commits 
    email list.</li>
    <li>The patch submitter is responsible for all aspects of the patch per 
    the <a href="quality">quality policy</a> above.</li>
    <li>If the patch is discovered to not meet the 
    <a href="quality">quality policy</a> standards within a reasonable time 
    frame (24 hours), it may be subject to reversal.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="c_access">Obtaining Commit Access</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>Commit access to the repository is granted according to this policy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Commit access is not granted to anyone unless they specifically ask for
    it.</li>
    <li>Requests for commit access must be sent to the 
    <a href="mailto:llvm-oversight@cs.uiuc.edu">LLVM Oversight Group</a>.</li>
    <li>Granting commit access is at the sole discretion of the LLVM Oversight
    Group.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Submitting patches to LLVM via the patch policy above will greatly 
  increase the chance that your request for commit access is granted. Getting 
  to know the members of the LLVM community (email, IRC, in person contact, 
  etc.) will also increase your chances.</p>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="c_new">New Committers</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>For those who have recently obtained commit access, the following policies
  apply:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You are granted <i>commit-after-approval</i> to all parts of LLVM.
    To get approval, submit a patch to 
    <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvm-commits">llvm-commits</a>
    per the <a href="#patches">patch policies</a> above.  When approved you 
    may commit it yourself.</li>
    <li>You are allowed to commit patches without approval which you think are
    obvious. This is clearly a subjective decision. We simply expect you to
    use good judgement.</li>
    <li>You are allowed to commit patches without approval to those portions 
    of LLVM that you own (contributed) or maintain (have been assigned 
    responsibility for), with the proviso that such commits must not break the 
    build. This is a "trust but verify" policy and commits of this nature are 
    reviewed after they are committed.</li>
    <li>Commits that violate the <a href="quality">quality standards</a> may
    be reverted. This is necessary when the change blocks other developers from
    making progress. The developer is welcome to re-commit the change after 
    the problem has been fixed.</li>
    <li>Multiple violations of these policies or a single egregious violation
    may cause commit access to be revoked.</li>

<div class="doc_text">
  <p>The LLVM project believes in correct attribution of contributions to 
  their contributors, as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Developers who originate new files in LLVM should place their name at
    the top of the file per the 
    <a href="CodingStandards.html">Coding Standards</a>.</li>
    <li>There should be only one name at the top of the file and it should be
    the person who created the file.</li>
    <li>Placing your name in the file does not imply copyright but does
    correctly attribute the file to its author.</li>
    <li>Developers should be aware that after some time has passed, the name at
    the top of a file may become meaningless as maintenance/ownership of files
    changes.</li>
    <li>Developers should submit or commit patches to the 
    <a href="http://llvm.org/cvsweb/cvsweb.cgi/llvm/CREDITS.TXT?rev=1.67&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">CREDITS.txt</a> 
    file to summarize their contributions.</li>
    <li>Commit comments should contain correct attribution of the person who
    submitted the patch if that person is not the committer (i.e. when a

  </ol>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="copyright">Copyright</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>
  <p>For consistency and ease of management, the project requires the 
  copyright for all LLVM software to be held by a single copyright holder.  
  Although UIUC may assign the copyright of the software to another entity, 
  the intent for the project is to always have a single entity hold the copy 
  rights to LLVM at any given time.
  <p>Having multiple copyright holders for various portions of LLVM is
  problematic in the management of the software. Having a single copyright 
  holder is in the best interests of all developers and users as it greatly 
  reduces the managerial burden for any kind of administrative or technical 
  decisions about LLVM.</p>
</div>
<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="license">License</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>LLVM licensing decisions will be made by the LLVM Oversight Group. Any
  issues, comments or suggestions with the licensing should be sent to the
  <a href="mailto:llvm-oversight@cs.uiuc.edu">LLVM Oversight Group</a>.</p>
  <p>The LLVM Oversight Group intends to keep LLVM perpetually open source 
  and to use liberal open source licenses. The current license is the 
  <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/UoI-NCSA.php">
    University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License</a>, which boils
  down to this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can freely distribute LLVM.</li>
    <li>You must retain the copyright notice if you redistribute LLVM.</li>
    <li>Binaries derived from LLVM must reproduce the copyright notice.</li>
    <li>You can't use our names to promote your LLVM derived products.</li>
    <li>There's no warranty on LLVM at all.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We believe this fosters the widest adoption of LLVM because it allows 
  commercial products to be derived from LLVM with few restrictions and
  without a requirement for making any derived works also open source (i.e. 
  LLVM's license is not a <i>copyleft</i> license). We suggest that you read 
  the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/UoI-NCSA.php">License</a> 
  if further clarification is needed.</p>
