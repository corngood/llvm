  <p>This document contains the LLVM Developer Policy which defines the
  project's policy towards developer's and their contributions. The intent of 
  this policy is to eliminate mis-communication, rework, and confusion that 
  might arise from the distributed nature of LLVM's development.  By stating 
  the policy in clear terms, we hope each developer can know ahead of time
  what to expect when making LLVM contributions.</p>

<div class="doc_text">
  <p>We address here the issues of copyright and license for the LLVM project.
  A copyright is literally the "right to copy". It is a set of exclusive rights
  granted to a party regulating the particular expression of information.
  In this case, the information is LLVM.  A license is something granted by a
  copyright holder to other parties that controls the use of the information
  by them. Currently, the University of Illinois is the LLVM copyright holder 
  and the terms of its license to LLVM users and developers is the 
  University of Illinois Open Source License (see LICENSE.txt).</p>
</div>
<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="copyright">Copyright</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>The LLVM project believes in correct attribution of contributions to 
  their contributors. Developers should, therefore, place their name at the 
  top of any source file they originate and list their contributions in the
  CREDITS.TXT file. Furthermore, correct attribution of submitted patches 
  should be made in the commit comments.</p>
  <p>However, for consistency and ease of management, the project requires the 
  copyright for all LLVM software to be held by a single copyright holder.  
  Although UIUC may assign the copyright of the software to another entity, 
  the intent for the project is to always have a single entity hold the copy 
  rights to LLVM at any given time.
  <p>Having multiple copyright holders for various portions of LLVM is
  problematic in the management of the software. Having a single copyright 
  holder is in the best interests of all developers and users as it greatly 
  reduces the managerial burden for any kind of administrative or technical 
  decisions about LLVM.</p>
</div>
<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="license">License</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>LLVM licensing decisions will be made by the LLVM Oversight Group. Any
  issues, comments or suggestions with the licensing should be sent to 
  <a href="mailto:oversight@llvm.org">oversight@llvm.org</a>.</p>
  <p>The LLVM Oversight Group intends to keep LLVM perpetually open source 
  and to use liberal open source licenses. The current license is the 
  University of Illinois Open Source License (see LICENSE.TXT), which boils
  down to this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can freely distribute LLVM.</li>
    <li>You must retain the copyright notice if you redistribute.</li>
    <li>Binaries derived from LLVM must reproduce the copyright notice.</li>
    <li>You can't use our names to promote your LLVM derived products.</li>
    <li>There's no warranty on LLVM at all.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We believe this fosters the widest adoption of LLVM because it allows 
  commercial products to be derived from LLVM with few restrictions and
  without a requirement for making any derived works also open source. The 
  intent of the license is to let people use LLVM freely with only the
  obligation to be honest about where it came from.</p>
</div>
<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="devagree">Developer Agreements</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>With regards to the LLVM copyright and licensing, developer's agree to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>give up their copy rights to any contribution made so that the entire 
    software base can be managed by a single copyright holder.</li>
    <li>allow their contribution(s) to be licensed as open source by the then
    current or subsequent license chosen by the LLVM Oversight Group.</li>
    <li>not make LLVM available under any other licensing agreement.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_section"><a name="general">General Policies</a></div>
<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>This section contains policies that pertain generally to LLVM developers. 
  <p>LLVM Developers are expected to meet the following obligations in order 
  for LLVM to maintain a high standard of quality<p>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="informed">Stay Informed</a> </div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>Developers should stay informed by reading at least the 
  <a href="mailto:llvmdev@llvm.org">llvmdev</a> email list.  If you are doing 
  anything more than just casual work on LLVM, it is highly suggested that you 
  also subscribe to the llvm-commits list and pay attention to changes being 
  made by others.</p>
  <p>Active developers must register an email account with bugzilla 
  (<a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/">http://llvm.org/bugs/</a>) and preferably
  subscribe to the llvm-bugs email list to keep track of bugs occuring in
  LLVM.</p>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="newwork">Starting New Work</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>When a developer begins new work with the aim of contributing it back to
  LLVM, s/he must inform the community with an email to llvm-dev email list, 
  to the extent possible. The reason for this is to:
  <ul>
    <li>keep the community informed about future changes to LLVM, </li>
    <li>avoid duplication of effort by having multiple parties working on the
    same thing and not knowing about it, and</li>
    <li>ensure that any issues around the proposed work are discussed and
    resolved before any significant work is accomplished.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="reviews">Code Reviews</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>LLVM has a code review policy. Code review is an excellent way to ensure
  high quality in the software. The following policies apply:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>All developers are required to have any significant changes reviewed 
    before they are committed to the repository.</li>
    <li>Code reviews are conducted by email.</li>
    <li>Code can be reviewed either before it is committed or after.</li>
    <li>The developer responsible for a code change is also responsible for
    making all necessary review changes.</li>
    <li>Developers should participate in code reviews as both a reviewer and 
    a reviewee. We don't have a dedicated team of reviewers. If someone is
    kind enough to review your code, you should return the favor for someone 
    else.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="incremental">Incremental Development</a>
</div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>LLVM uses an incremental development style and all developers are expected
  to follow this practice. Incremental development is a big key to LLVM's
  success and it is essential that developers submit incremental patches. The
  following defines the incremental development approach:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The first task is to define the increment and get consensus (with the
    LLVM development community) on what the end goal of the change is. Making 
    random small changes that go nowhere is not useful for anyone.</li>
    <li>An increment is the smallest patch size necessary to effect one change 
    in LLVM.</li>
    <li>Increments can be stand alone (e.g. to fix a bug), or part of a planned
    series of increments towards some development goal.</li>
    <li>Increments should be kept as small as possible. This simplifies your 
    work (into a logical progression), simplifies code review and reduces the
    chance that you will get negative feedback on the change. Small increments
    also facilitate the maintenance of a high quality code base.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="quality">Quality</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>The minimum quality standards for any change to the main development 
  branch are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Code must adhere to the 
    <a href="CodingStandards.html">LLVM Coding Standards</a>.</li>
    <li>Code must compile cleanly (no errors, no warnings) on at least one 
    platform.</li>
    <li>Code must pass the deja gnu (llvm/test) test suite.</li>
    <li>
  </ol>
  <p>Additionally, the committer is responsible for all of the following items.
  It is considered significantly preferable for all of these items to be 
  accounted for <i>before</i> the code is submitted for review or committed.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Code must compile cleanly on all platforms.</li>
    <li>Code must pass the <tt>llvm-test</tt> test suite including 
    SPEC CINT2000, SPEC CFP2000, SPEC CINT2006, and SPEC CFP2006.</li>
    <li>The changesat must not cause performance or correctness regressions 
    for the LLVM tools.</li>
    <li>The changes must not cause performance or correctness regressions in 
    code compiled with LLVM on all applicable targets.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________ -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="testcases">Test Cases</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
  <p>Developers are required to create test cases for regressions and new
  features and include them with their changes. The following policies
  apply:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>All feature and regression test cases must be added to the 
    <tt>llvm/test</tt> directory. The appropriate subdirectory should be 
    selected (see the <a href="TestingGuide.html">Testing Guide</a> for 
    details.</li>
    <li>Test cases should be written in LLVM assembly language unless the
    feature or regression being tested requires another language.</li>
    <li>Test cases, especially for regressions, should be as reduced as 
    possible, preferably by 
    <a href=CommandGuide/html/bugpoint.html>bugpoint</a>.  It is unacceptable 
    to place an entire failing program into <tt>llvm/test</tt> as this creates
    a <i>time-to-test</i> burden on all developers. Keep them short!</li>
    <li>More extensive test cases (applications, benchmarks, etc.) should be 
    added to the <tt>llvm-test</tt> test suite, after approval from the
    Oversight Group. This test suite is for coverage not features or 
    regressions.</li>

    <li>You are granted <i>commit-without-approavl</i> to those portions of LLVM
    that you own (contributed) or maintain (have been assigned responsibility
