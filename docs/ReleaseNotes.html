<p>
The LLVM 2.9 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM
repository (which roughly includes the LLVM optimizers, code generators
and supporting tools), the Clang repository and the llvm-gcc repository.  In
addition to this code, the LLVM Project includes other sub-projects that are in
development.  Here we include updates on these subprojects.
</p>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="clang">Clang: C/C++/Objective-C Frontend Toolkit</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> is an LLVM front end for the C,
C++, and Objective-C languages. Clang aims to provide a better user experience
through expressive diagnostics, a high level of conformance to language
standards, fast compilation, and low memory use. Like LLVM, Clang provides a
modular, library-based architecture that makes it suitable for creating or
integrating with other development tools. Clang is considered a
production-quality compiler for C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ on x86
(32- and 64-bit), and for darwin-arm targets.</p>

<p>In the LLVM 2.9 time-frame, the Clang team has made many improvements in C,
C++ and Objective-C support.  C++ support is now generally rock solid, has
been exercised on a broad variety of code, and has several new C++'0x features
implemented (such as rvalue references and variadic templates).  LLVM 2.9 has
also brought in a large range of bug fixes and minor features (e.g. __label__
support), and is much more compatible with the Linux Kernel.</p>  
  
<p>If Clang rejects your code that is built with another compiler, please take a
look at the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/compatibility.html">language
compatibility</a> guide to make sure the issue isn't intentional or a known
issue.
</p>

<a name="dragonegg">DragonEgg: GCC front-ends, LLVM back-end</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
<a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">DragonEgg</a> is a
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/plugins">gcc plugin</a> that replaces GCC's
optimizers and code generators with LLVM's.
Currently it requires a patched version of gcc-4.5.
The plugin can target the x86-32 and x86-64 processor families and has been
used successfully on the Darwin, FreeBSD and Linux platforms.
The Ada, C, C++ and Fortran languages work well.
The plugin is capable of compiling plenty of Obj-C, Obj-C++ and Java but it is
not known whether the compiled code actually works or not!
</p>

<p>
The 2.9 release has the following notable changes:
<ul>
<li>The plugin is much more stable when compiling Fortran.</li>
<li>Inline asm where an asm output is tied to an input of a different size is
now supported in many more cases.</li>
<li>Basic support for the __float128 type was added.  It is now possible to
generate LLVM IR from programs using __float128 but code generation does not
work yet.</li>
<li>Compiling Java programs no longer systematically crashes the plugin.</li>
</ul>

<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="compiler-rt">compiler-rt: Compiler Runtime Library</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The new LLVM <a href="http://compiler-rt.llvm.org/">compiler-rt project</a>
is a simple library that provides an implementation of the low-level
target-specific hooks required by code generation and other runtime components.
For example, when compiling for a 32-bit target, converting a double to a 64-bit
unsigned integer is compiled into a runtime call to the "__fixunsdfdi"
function. The compiler-rt library provides highly optimized implementations of
this and other low-level routines (some are 3x faster than the equivalent
libgcc routines).</p>

<p>
All of the code in the compiler-rt project is available under the standard LLVM
License, a "BSD-style" license.  

compiler_rt is now dual licensed under MIT and UIUC license
  
Several minor changes for better ARM support.

<a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/">LLDB</a> is a brand new member of the LLVM
umbrella of projects. LLDB is a next generation, high-performance debugger. It
is built as a set of reusable components which highly leverage existing
libraries in the larger LLVM Project, such as the Clang expression parser, the
LLVM disassembler and the LLVM JIT.</p>

<p>
LLDB is in early development and not included as part of the LLVM 2.9 release,

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="majorfeatures">Major New Features</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 2.9 includes several major new capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><pre>
  last release for llvm-gcc
TBAA: On by default in clang.  Disable it with -fno-strict-aliasing.
  Could be more aggressive for structs.
  
Triple::normalize is new, llvm triples are always stored in normalized form internally.

Triple x86_64--mingw64 is obsoleted. Use x86_64--mingw32 instead.

MC Assembler: X86 now generates much better diagnostics for common errors,
    is much faster at matching instructions, is much more bug-compatible with
    the GAS assembler, and is now generally useful for a broad range of X86
    assembly.
  
New Nvidia PTX backend, not generally useful in 2.9 though.

Much better debug info generated, particularly in optimized code situations.

ARM Fast ISel

ELF MC support: on by default in clang.  There are still known missing features
  for human written assembly.

X86: Reimplemented all of MMX to introduce a new LLVM IR x86_mmx type.  Now
  random types like &lt;2 x i32&gt; are not iseld to mmx without emms.  The
  -disable-mmx flag is gone now.

Some basic <a href="CodeGenerator.html#mc">internals documentation</a> for MC. 
  
MC Assembler support for .file and .loc.
  
  
inline asm multiple alternative constraint support.
  
LoopIdiom: memset/memcpy formation.  Build with -ffreestanding or -fno-builtin
  if your memcpy is being compiled into infinite recursion.
  

TargetLibraryInfo
  
X86 support for FS/GS relative loads and stores using address space 256/257 are
  reliable now.
  
ARM: New code placement pass.
  
unnamed_addr + PR8927
  
PointerTracking has been removed from mainline, moved to ClamAV.
  
EarlyCSE pass.
LoopInstSimplify pass.

- DIBuilder provides simpler interface for front ends like Clang to encode debug info in LLVM IR.
  - This interface hides implementation details (e.g. DIDerivedType, existence of compile unit etc..) that any front end should not know about.
  For example,
  Ty = DebugFactory.CreateDerivedType(DW_TAG_volatile_type,
  findRegion(TYPE_CONTEXT(type)),
  StringRef(),
  getOrCreateFile(main_input_filename),
  0 /*line no*/,
  NodeSizeInBits(type),
  NodeAlignInBits(type),
  0 /*offset */,
  0 /* flags */,
  MainTy);
  can be replaced by
  DbgTy = DBuilder.createQualifiedType(DW_TAG_volatile_type, MainTy); 
  
PPC: Switched to MCInstPrinter, and MCCodeEmitter.  Ready to implement support
  for directly writing out mach-o object files, but noone seems interested.

ARM: Improved code generation for Cortex-A8 and Cortex-A9 CPUs.
  
Scheduler now models operand latency and pipeline forwarding.
  
error_code + libsystem + PathV2 changes
  The system_error header from C++0x was added.
  * Use if (error_code ec = function()) to check for error conditions
  from functions which return it.
  * error_code::message returns a human readable description of the error.
  
  PathV1 has been deprecated in favor of PathV2 (sorry I didn't finish
  this before the release).
  * No Path class, use a r-value convertible to a twine instead.
  * Assumes all paths are UTF-8.
  
new macho-dump tool

Major regalloc rewrite, not on by default for 2.9 and not advised to use it.
 * New basic register allocator that can be used as a safe fallback when
   debugging. Enable with -regalloc=basic.
 * New infrastructure for live range splitting. SplitKit can break a live
   interval into smaller pieces while preserving SSA form, and SpillPlacement
   can help find the best split points. This is a work in progress so the API
   is changing quickly.
 * The inline spiller has learned to clean up after live range splitting. It
   can hoist spills out of loops, and it can eliminate redundant spills.
   Rematerialization works with live range splitting.
 * New greedy register allocator using live range splitting. This will be the
   default register allocator in the next LLVM release, but it is not turned on
   by default in 2.9.

ARM: __builtin_prefetch turns into prefetch instructions.
  
MC assembler support for 3dNow! and 3DNowA instructions.
  
tblgen support for assembler aliases: <a 
  href="CodeGenerator.html#na_instparsing">MnemonicAlias and InstAlias</a>
  
LoopIndexSplit pass was removed, unmaintained.
  
include/llvm/System merged into include/llvm/Support.
 
Win32 PE-COFF support in the MC assembler has made a lot of progress in the 2.9
  timeframe, but is still not generally useful.  Please see 
  "http://llvm.org/bugs/showdependencytree.cgi?id=9100&amp;hide_resolved=1" for open bugs?

New <a href="WritingAnLLVMPass.html#RegionPass">RegionPass</a> infrastructure
  for region-based optimizations.
  
MicroBlaze: major updates for aggressive delay slot filler, MC-based assembly
   printing, assembly instruction parsing, ELF .o file emission, and MC
   instruction disassembler.
  
Countless ARM microoptimizations.

Speedups to various mid-level passes:
  GVN is much faster on functions with deep dominator trees / lots of BBs.
  DomTree and DominatorFrontier are much faster to compute, and preserved by
    more passes (so they are computed less often)
  SRoA is also much faster and doesn't use DominanceFrontier.
  
  
new 'hotpatch' attribute: LangRef.html#fnattrs

APInt API changes, see PR5207.

DSE is more aggressive with stores of different types: e.g. a large store 
  following a small one to the same address.
  
New naming rules in coding standards: CodingStandards.html#ll_naming
  
LiveDebugVariables is a new pass that keeps track of debugging information for
  user variables that are kept in registers in optimized builds.
  
We now optimize various idioms for overflow detection into check of the flag
  register on various CPUs, e.g.:
   unsigned long t = a+b;
   if (t &lt; a) ...
  into:
  	addq	%rdi, %rbx
  	jno	LBB0_2

X86: Much better codegen for several cases using adc/sbb instead of cmovs for
  conditional increment and other idioms.
  
MVT::Flag renamed to MVT::Glue
  
Removed the PartialSpecialization pass, it was unmaintained and buggy.
  
SPARC: Many improvements, including using the Y registers for multiplications
  and addition of a simple delay slot filler.

   major language feature of GCC not supported by llvm-gcc is the
   <tt>__builtin_apply</tt> family of builtins.   However, some extensions
   are only supported on some targets.  For example, trampolines are only
   supported on some targets (these are used when you take the address of a
   nested function).</p>

<p>Fortran support generally works, but there are still several unresolved bugs
   in <a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/">Bugzilla</a>.  Please see the
   tools/gfortran component for details.  Note that llvm-gcc is missing major
   Fortran performance work in the frontend and library that went into GCC after
   4.2.  If you are interested in Fortran, we recommend that you consider using
   <a href="#dragonegg">dragonegg</a> instead.</p>

<p>The llvm-gcc 4.2 Ada compiler has basic functionality, but is no longer being
actively maintained.  If you are interested in Ada, we recommend that you
consider using <a href="#dragonegg">dragonegg</a> instead.</p>
