<a name="changes">Major Changes in LLVM 2.3</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 2.3 no longer supports llvm-gcc 4.0, it has been replaced with
   llvm-gcc 4.2.</p>

<p>LLVM 2.3 no longer includes the <tt>llvm-upgrade</tt> tool.  It was useful
   for upgrading LLVM 1.9 files to LLVM 2.x syntax, but you can always use a
   previous LLVM release to do this.  One nice impact of this is that the LLVM
   regression test suite no longer depends on llvm-upgrade, which makes it run
   faster.</p>

<p>The <tt>llvm2cpp</tt> tool has been folded into llc, use
    <tt>llc -march=cpp</tt> instead of <tt>llvm2cpp</tt>.</p>

<p>LLVM API Changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Several core LLVM IR classes have migrated to use the
    '<tt>FOOCLASS::Create(...)</tt>' pattern instead of '<tt>new 
    FOOCLASS(...)</tt>' (e.g. where FOOCLASS=<tt>BasicBlock</tt>).  We hope to
    standardize on <tt>FOOCLASS::Create</tt> for all IR classes in the future,
    but not all of them have been moved over yet.</li>
<li>LLVM 2.3 renames the LLVMBuilder and LLVMFoldingBuilder classes to
   IRBuilder.</li>
<li>MRegisterInfo was renamed to TargetRegisterInfo.</li>
<li>The MappedFile class is gone, please use MemoryBuffer instead.</li>
<li>The '<tt>-enable-eh</tt>' flag to llc has been removed.  Now code should 
    encode whether it is safe to omit unwind information for a function by
    tagging the Function object with the '<tt>nounwind</tt>' attribute.</li>

</ul>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The core LLVM 2.3 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM
repository (which roughly contains the LLVM optimizer, code generators and
supporting tools) and the llvm-gcc repository.  In addition to this code, the
LLVM Project includes other sub-projects that are in development.  The two which
are the most actively developed are the new <a href="#vmkit">vmkit Project</a>
and the <a href="#clang">Clang Project</a>. 
</p>
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsubsection">
<a name="vmkit">vmkit</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The "vmkit" project is a new addition to the LLVM family.  It is an
implementation of a JVM and a CLI Virtual Machines (Microsoft .NET is an
implementation of the CLI) using the Just-In-Time compiler of LLVM.</p>

<p>The JVM, called JnJVM, executes real-world applications such as Apache
projects (e.g. Felix and Tomcat) and the SpecJVM98 benchmark.  It uses the GNU
Classpath project for the base classes.  The CLI implementation, called N3, is
its in early stages but can execute simple applications and the "pnetmark"
benchmark. It uses the pnetlib project as its core library.</p>

<p>The 'vmkit' VMs compare in performance with industrial and top open-source
VMs on scientific applications.  Besides the JIT, the VMs use many features of
the LLVM framework, including the standard set of optimizations, atomic
operations, custom function provider and memory manager for JITed methods, and
specific virtual machine optimizations. vmkit is not an official part of LLVM
2.3 release. It is publicly available under the LLVM license and can be
downloaded from:

<div class="doc_subsubsection">
<a name="clang">Clang</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang project</a> is an effort to build
a set of new 'LLVM native' front-end technologies for the LLVM optimizer
and code generator.  Clang is continuing to make major strides forward in all
areas.  Its C and Objective-C parsing support is very solid, and the code
generation support is far enough along to build many C applications.  While not
yet production quality, it is progressing very nicely.  In addition, C++
front-end work has started to make significant progress.</p>

<p>At this point, Clang is most useful if you are interested in source-to-source
transformations (such as refactoring) and other source-level tools for C and
Objective-C.  Clang now also includes tools for turning C code into pretty HTML,
and includes a new <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/StaticAnalysis.html">static
analysis tool</a> in development.  This tool is automatically focused on finding
bugs in C and Objective-C code.</p>

</div>
<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="majorfeatures">Major New Features</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 2.3 includes several major new capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The biggest change in LLVM 2.3 is Multiple Return Value (MRV) support.
    MRVs allow LLVM IR to directly represent functions that return multiple
    values without having to pass them "by reference" in the LLVM IR.  This
    allows a front-end to generate more efficient code, as MRVs are generally
    returned in registers if a target supports them.  See the <a
    href="LangRef.html#i_getresult">LLVM IR Reference</a> for more details.</p>
    
 <p>MRVs are fully supported in the LLVM IR, but are not yet fully supported in
    on all targets.  However, it is generally safe to return up to 2 values from
    a function: most targets should be able to handle at least that.  MRV
    support is a critical requirement for X86-64 ABI support, as X86-64 requires
    the ability to return multiple registers from functions, and we use MRVs to
    accomplish this in a direct way.</p></li>

<li><p>LLVM 2.3 includes a complete reimplementation of the "<tt>llvmc</tt>"
    tool.  It is designed to overcome several problems with the original 
    <tt>llvmc</tt> and to provide a superset of the features of the
    '<tt>gcc</tt>' driver.</p>

<p>The main features of <tt>llvmc2</tt> are:
    <ul>
    <li>Extended handling of command line options and smart rules for
    dispatching them to different tools.</li>
    <li>Flexible (and extensible) rules for defining different tools.</li>
    <li>The different intermediate steps performed by tools are represented
    as edges in the abstract graph.</li>
    <li>The 'language' for driver behavior definition is tablegen and thus
    it's relatively easy to add new features.</li>
    <li>The definition of driver is transformed into set of C++ classes, thus
    no runtime interpretation is needed.</li>
    </ul></p>
    </li>

<li><p>LLVM 2.3 includes a completely rewritten interface for <a
    href="LinkTimeOptimization.html">Link Time Optimization</a>.  This interface
    is written in C, which allows for easier integration with C code bases, and
    incorporates improvements we learned about from the first incarnation of the
    interface.</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="tutorial/LangImpl1.html">Kaleidoscope tutorial</a> now
    includes a "port" of the tutorial that <a 
    href="tutorial/OCamlLangImpl1.html">uses the Ocaml bindings</a> to implement
    the Kaleidoscope language.</p></li>

</ul>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="llvm-gcc">llvm-gcc 4.2 Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 2.3 fully supports the llvm-gcc 4.2 front-end.</p>

<p>llvm-gcc 4.2 includes numerous fixes to better support the Objective-C
front-end.  Objective-C now works very well on Mac OS/X.</p>

<p>Fortran EQUIVALENCEs are now supported by the gfortran front-end.</p>

<p>llvm-gcc 4.2 includes many other fixes which improve conformance with the
relevant parts of the GCC testsuite.</p>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="coreimprovements">LLVM Core Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>New features include:
</p>


Common linkage?

Atomic operation support, Alpha, X86, X86-64, PowerPC. "__sync_synchronize", 
"__sync_val_compare_and_swap", etc

<ul>
<li>The C and Ocaml bindings have received additional improvements. The
bindings now cover pass managers, several transformation passes, iteration
over the LLVM IR, target data, and parameter attribute lists.</li>
</ul>
  
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="optimizer">Optimizer Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>In addition to a huge array of bug fixes and minor performance tweaks, the 
LLVM 2.3 optimizers support a few major enhancements:</p>

<ul>

<li>Loop index set splitting on by default.<p>
This transformation hoists conditions from loop bodies and reduces loop's
iteration space to improve performance. For example, <p>
<pre>
for (i = LB; i &lt; UB; ++i)
  if (i &lt;= NV)
    LOOP_BODY
</pre>
is transformed into
<pre>
NUB = min(NV+1, UB)
for (i = LB; i &lt; NUB; ++i)
  LOOP_BODY
</pre>
</li>

<li>LLVM includes a new <tt>memcpy</tt> optimization pass which removes
dead <tt>memcpy</tt> calls, unneeded copies of aggregates, and performs
return slot optimization.  The LLVM optimizer now notices long sequences of
consecutive stores and merges them into <tt>memcpy</tt>'s where profitable.</li>

<li>Alignment detection for vector memory references and for <tt>memcpy</tt> and
<tt>memset</tt> is now more aggressive.</li> 

<li>The aggressive dead code elimination (ADCE) optimization has been rewritten
to make it both faster and safer in the presence of code containing infinite
loops.  Some of its prior functionality has been factored out into the loop
deletion pass, which <em>is</em> safe for infinite loops.</li>

<li>Several optimizations have been sped up, leading to faster code generation
    with the same code quality.</li>
    
<li>The 'SimplifyLibCalls' pass, which optimizes calls to libc and libm
    functions for C-based languages, has been rewritten to be a FunctionPass
    instead a ModulePass.  This allows it to be run more often and to be
    included at -O1 in llvm-gcc.  It was also extended to include more
    optimizations and several corner case bugs were fixed.</li>

<li>LLVM now includes a simple 'Jump Threading' pass, which attempts to simplify
    conditional branches using information about predecessor blocks, simplifying
    the control flow graph.  This pass is pretty basic at this point, but
    catches some important cases and provides a foundation to build on.</li>
    
<li>Several corner case bugs which could lead to deleting volatile memory
    accesses have been fixed.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="codegen">Code Generator Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>We put a significant amount of work into the code generator infrastructure,
which allows us to implement more aggressive algorithms and make it run
faster:</p>

<ul>
<li>The code generator now has support for carrying information about memory
    references throughout the entire code generation process, via the
    <a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1MachineMemOperand.html">
    MachineMemOperand</a> class. In the future this will be used to improve
    both pre-pass and post-pass scheduling, and to improve compiler-debugging
    output.</li>

<li>The target-independent code generator infrastructure now uses LLVM's APInt
    class to handle integer values, which allows it to support integer types
    larger than 64 bits. Note that support for such types is also dependent on
    target-specific support. Use of APInt is also a step toward support for
    non-power-of-2 integer sizes.</li>
    
<li>LLVM 2.3 includes several compile time speedups for code with large basic
    blocks, particularly in the instruction selection phase, register
    allocation, scheduling, and tail merging/jump threading.</li>

<li>Several improvements which make llc's <tt>--view-sunit-dags</tt>
    visualization of scheduling dependency graphs easier to understand.</li>
    
<li>The code generator allows targets to write patterns that generate subreg
    references directly in .td files now.</li>
    
<li><tt>memcpy</tt> lowering in the backend is more aggressive, particularly for
    <tt>memcpy</tt> calls introduced by the code generator when handling
    pass-by-value structure argument copies.</li>
    
<li>Inline assembly with multiple register results now returns those results
    directly in the appropriate registers, rather than going through memory.
    Inline assembly that uses constraints like "ir" with immediates now use the
    'i' form when possible instead of always loading the value in a register.
    This saves an instruction and reduces register use.</li>

<li>Added support for PIC/GOT style tail calls on x86/32 and initial support
    for tail calls on PowerPC 32 (it may also work on ppc64 but not
    thoroughly tested).</li>
</ul>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="x86specific">X86/X86-64 Specific Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>New target-specific features include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>llvm-gcc's X86-64 ABI conformance is far improved, particularly in the
    area of passing and returning structures by value.  llvm-gcc compiled code
    now interoperates very well on X86-64 systems with other compilers.</li>

<li>Support for Win64 was added. This includes code generation itself, JIT
    support and necessary changes to llvm-gcc.</li>

<li>The LLVM X86 backend now supports the support SSE 4.1 instruction set, and
    the llvm-gcc 4.2 front-end supports the SSE 4.1 compiler builtins.  Various
    generic vector operations (insert/extract/shuffle) are much more efficient
    when SSE 4.1 is enabled.  The JIT automatically takes advantage of these
    instructions, but llvm-gcc must be explicitly told to use them, e.g. with
    <tt>-march=penryn</tt>.</li>

<li>The X86 backend now does a number of optimizations that aim to avoid
    converting numbers back and forth from SSE registers to the X87 floating
    point stack.</li>

<li>The X86 backend supports stack realignment, which is particularly useful for
    vector code on OS's without 16-byte aligned stacks.</li>

<li>The X86 backend now supports the "sseregparm" options in GCC, which allow
    functions to be tagged as passing floating point values in SSE
    registers.</li>

<li>Trampolines (taking the address of a nested function) now work on
    Linux/X86-64.</li>

<li><tt>__builtin_prefetch</tt> is now compiled into the appropriate prefetch
    instructions instead of being ignored.</li>

<li>128-bit integers are now supported on X86-64 targets.</li>

<li>The register allocator can now rematerialize PIC-base computations.</li>

<li>The "t" and "f" inline assembly constraints for the X87 floating point stack
    now work.  However, the "u" constraint is still not fully supported.</li>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The C++ front-end is considered to be fully
tested and works for a number of non-trivial programs, including LLVM
itself, Qt, Mozilla, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>Exception handling works well on the X86 and PowerPC targets, including
X86-64 darwin.  This works when linking to a libstdc++ compiled by GCC.  It is
supported on X86-64 linux, but that is disabled by default in this release.</li>

  <a name="ada-fe">Known problems with the llvm-gcc Ada front-end</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
The llvm-gcc 4.2 Ada compiler works fairly well, however this is not a mature
technology and problems should be expected.
<ul>
<li>The Ada front-end currently only builds on X86-32.  This is mainly due
to lack of trampoline support (pointers to nested functions) on other platforms,
however it <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2006">also fails to build on X86-64</a>
which does support trampolines.</li>
<li>The Ada front-end <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2007">fails to bootstrap</a>.
Workaround: configure with --disable-bootstrap.</li>
<li>The c380004 and <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a> ACATS tests
fail (c380004 also fails with gcc-4.2 mainline).  When built at -O3, the
<a href="http://llvm.org/PR2421">cxg2021</a> ACATS test also fails.</li>
<li>Some gcc specific Ada tests continue to crash the compiler.  The testsuite
reports most tests as having failed even though they pass.</li>
<li>The -E binder option (exception backtraces)
<a href="http://llvm.org/PR1982">does not work</a> and will result in programs
crashing if an exception is raised.  Workaround: do not use -E.</li>
<li>Only discrete types <a href="http://llvm.org/PR1981">are allowed to start
or finish at a non-byte offset</a> in a record.  Workaround: do not pack records
or use representation clauses that result in a field of a non-discrete type
starting or finishing in the middle of a byte.</li>
<li>The <tt>lli</tt> interpreter <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2009">considers
'main' as generated by the Ada binder to be invalid</a>.
Workaround: hand edit the file to use pointers for <tt>argv</tt> and
<tt>envp</tt> rather than integers.</li>
<li>The <tt>-fstack-check</tt> option <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2008">is
ignored</a>.</li>
</ul>
