The LLVM 2.8 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM
repository (which roughly includes the LLVM optimizers, code generators
and supporting tools), the Clang repository and the llvm-gcc repository.  In
addition to this code, the LLVM Project includes other sub-projects that are in
development.  Here we include updates on these subprojects.

<a name="clang">Clang: C/C++/Objective-C Frontend Toolkit</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> is an LLVM front end for the C,
C++, and Objective-C languages. Clang aims to provide a better user experience
through expressive diagnostics, a high level of conformance to language
standards, fast compilation, and low memory use. Like LLVM, Clang provides a
modular, library-based architecture that makes it suitable for creating or
integrating with other development tools. Clang is considered a
production-quality compiler for C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ on x86
(32- and 64-bit), and for darwin-arm targets.</p>

<p>In the LLVM 2.8 time-frame, the Clang team has made many improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Surely these guys have done something</li>
<li>X86-64 abi improvements? Did they make it in?</li>
</ul>

<a name="clangsa">Clang Static Analyzer</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The <a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">Clang Static Analyzer</a>
   project is an effort to use static source code analysis techniques to
   automatically find bugs in C and Objective-C programs (and hopefully <a
   href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/dev_cxx.html">C++ in the
   future</a>!).  The tool is very good at finding bugs that occur on specific
   paths through code, such as on error conditions.</p>

<p>The LLVM 2.8 release fixes a number of bugs and slightly improves precision
   over 2.7, but there are no major new features in the release. 
</p>

</div>

<a name="vmkit">VMKit: JVM/CLI Virtual Machine Implementation</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The <a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org/">VMKit project</a> is an implementation of
a JVM and a CLI Virtual Machine (Microsoft .NET is an
implementation of the CLI) using LLVM for static and just-in-time
compilation.</p>

<p>With the release of LLVM 2.8, ...</p>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="compiler-rt">compiler-rt: Compiler Runtime Library</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The new LLVM <a href="http://compiler-rt.llvm.org/">compiler-rt project</a>
is a simple library that provides an implementation of the low-level
target-specific hooks required by code generation and other runtime components.
For example, when compiling for a 32-bit target, converting a double to a 64-bit
unsigned integer is compiled into a runtime call to the "__fixunsdfdi"
function. The compiler-rt library provides highly optimized implementations of
this and other low-level routines (some are 3x faster than the equivalent
libgcc routines).</p>

<p>
All of the code in the compiler-rt project is available under the standard LLVM
License, a "BSD-style" license.  New in LLVM 2.8, compiler_rt now supports 
soft floating point (for targets that don't have a real floating point unit),
and includes an extensive testsuite for the "blocks" language feature and the
blocks runtime included in compiler_rt.</p>

<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="dragonegg">DragonEgg: llvm-gcc ported to gcc-4.5</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
<a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">DragonEgg</a> is a port of llvm-gcc to
gcc-4.5.  Unlike llvm-gcc, dragonegg in theory does not require any gcc-4.5
modifications whatsoever (currently one small patch is needed) thanks to the
new <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/plugins">gcc plugin architecture</a>.
DragonEgg is a gcc plugin that makes gcc-4.5 use the LLVM optimizers and code
generators instead of gcc's, just like with llvm-gcc.
</p>

<p>
DragonEgg is still a work in progress, but it is able to compile a lot of code,
for example all of gcc, LLVM and clang.  Currently Ada, C, C++ and Fortran work
well, while all other languages either don't work at all or only work poorly.
For the moment only the x86-32 and x86-64 targets are supported, and only on
linux and darwin (darwin may need additional gcc patches).
</p>

<p>
The 2.8 release has the following notable changes:
<ul>
<li>The plugin loads faster due to exporting fewer symbols.</li>
<li>Additional vector operations such as addps256 are now supported.</li>
<li>Ada global variables with no initial value are no longer zero initialized,
resulting in better optimization.</li>
<li>The '-fplugin-arg-dragonegg-enable-gcc-optzns' flag now runs all gcc
optimizers, rather than just a handful.</li>
<li>Fortran programs using common variables now link correctly.</li>
<li>GNU OMP constructs no longer crash the compiler.</li>

programs down to synthesizable VHDL and parallel program binaries. Processor
customization points include the register files, function units, supported
operations, and the interconnection network.</p>

<p>TCE uses llvm-gcc/Clang and LLVM for C/C++ language support, target
independent optimizations and also for parts of code generation. It generates
new LLVM-based code generators "on the fly" for the designed TTA processors and
loads them in to the compiler backend as runtime libraries to avoid per-target
recompilation of larger parts of the compiler chain.</p>

<a name="mc">MC Level Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The LLVM Machine Code (aka MC) subsystem was created to solve a number
of problems in the realm of assembly, disassembly, object file format handling,
and a number of other related areas that CPU instruction-set level tools work
in.</p>

<p>The MC subproject has made great leaps in LLVM 2.8.  For example, support for
   directly writing .o files from LLC (and clang) now works reliably for
   darwin/x86[-64] (including inline assembly support) and the integrated
   assembler is turned on by default in Clang for these targets.  This provides
   improved compile times among other things.</p>

<ul>
<li>The entire compiler has converted over to using the MCStreamer assembler API
    instead of writing out a .s file textually.</li>
<li>The "assembler parser" is far more mature than in 2.7, supporting a full
    complement of directives, now supports assembler macros, etc.</li>
<li>The "assembler backend" has been completed, including support for relaxation
    relocation processing and all the other things that an assembler does.</li>
<li>The MachO file format support is now fully functional and works.</li>
<li>The MC disassembler now fully supports ARM and Thumb.  ARM assembler support
    is still in early development though.</li>
<li>The X86 MC assembler now supports the X86 AES and AVX instruction set.</li>
<li>Work on ELF and COFF support is well underway, but isn't useful yet in LLVM
    2.8.  Please contact the llvmdev mailing list if you're interested in
    this.</li>

<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="codegen">Target Independent Code Generator Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>We have put a significant amount of work into the code generator
infrastructure, which allows us to implement more aggressive algorithms and make
it run faster:</p>

<ul>
<li></li>

  MachineCSE tuned and on by default.

  Rewrote tblgen's type inference for backends to be more consistent and
     diagnose more target bugs.  This also allows limited support for writing
     patterns for instructions that return multiple results, e.g. a virtual
     register and a flag result.  Stuff that used 'parallel' before should use
     this.

  New -regalloc=fast,  =local got removed
  New -regalloc=default option that chooses a register allocator based on the -O optimization level.
  New SubRegIndex tblgen class for targets -> jakob

  Bottom up fast isel.  Simple Load reuse.  No more machinedce.
  IR ABI: <3 x float> is passed as <4 x float> instead of 3 floats.

  New COPY instruction. copyRegToReg -> copyPhysReg, isMoveInstr is gone.
  RenderMachineFunction: -rendermf
  SplitKit?
  Evan: Teach bottom up pre-ra scheduler to track register pressure. Work in progress.
  Evan: Add an ILP scheduler.  On x86_64, this is a win for all tests in CFP2000. It also sped up 256.bzip2 by 16%.

  New OptimizeExts+OptimizeCmps -> PeepholeOptimizer pass
  New LocalStackSlotAllocation.cpp pass (jimg)
  Atomics now get legalized when not natively supported (jim g)

  -ffunction-sections and -fdata-sections are supported on ELF targets.
  -momit-leaf-frame-pointer now supported.

</ul>
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="x86">X86-32 and X86-64 Target Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>New features of the X86 target include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The X86 backend now supports holding X87 floating point stack values
    in registers across basic blocks, dramatically improving performance of code
    that uses long double, and when targetting CPUs that don't support SSE.</li>

  New SSEDomainFix pass: 
    On Nehalem and newer CPUs there is a 2 cycle latency penalty on using a
    register in a different domain than where it was defined. Some instructions
    have equvivalents for different domains, like por/orps/orpd.  The
    SSEDomainFix pass tries to minimize the number of domain crossings by
    changing between equvivalent opcodes where possible.

  X86 backend attempts to promote 16-bit integer operations to 32-bits to avoid
     0x66 prefixes, which are slow on some microarchitectures and bloat the code
     on others.

  New support for X86 "thiscall" calling convention (x86_thiscallcc in IR) for windows.

  New llvm.x86.int intrinsic (for int $42 and int3)

  Verbose assembly decodes X86 shuffle instructions, e.g.:
  	insertps	$113, %xmm3, %xmm0     ## xmm0 = zero,xmm0[1,2],xmm3[1]
	unpcklps	%xmm1, %xmm0    ## xmm0 = xmm0[0],xmm1[0],xmm0[1],xmm1[1]
	pshufd	$1, %xmm1, %xmm1        ## xmm1 = xmm1[1,0,0,0]
        
  X86 ABI:  <2 x float> in IR no longer maps onto MMX, it turns into <4 x float>

  new GHC calling convention

<a name="ARM">ARM Target Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>New features of the ARM target include:
</p>

<ul>

  NEON: Better performance for QQQQ (4-consecutive Q register) instructions.  New reg sequence abstraction?
  ARM: Better scheduling (list-hybrid, hybrid?)
  ARM: Tail call support.
  ARM: General performance work and tuning.

  ARM: Half float support through intrinsics LangRef.html#int_fp16
<li>ARMGlobalMerge: <!-- Anton --> </li>

<li>The ARM NEON intrinsics have been substantially reworked to reduce
    redundancy and improve code generation.  Some of the major changes are:
  <ol>
  <li>
    All of the NEON load and store intrinsics (llvm.arm.neon.vld* and
    llvm.arm.neon.vst*) take an extra parameter to specify the alignment in bytes
    of the memory being accessed.
  </li>
  <li>
    The llvm.arm.neon.vaba intrinsic (vector absolute difference and
    accumulate) has been removed.  This operation is now represented using
    the llvm.arm.neon.vabd intrinsic (vector absolute difference) followed by a
    vector add.
  </li>
  <li>
    The llvm.arm.neon.vabdl and llvm.arm.neon.vabal intrinsics (lengthening
    vector absolute difference with and without accumlation) have been removed.
    They are represented using the llvm.arm.neon.vabd intrinsic (vector absolute
    difference) followed by a vector zero-extend operation, and for vabal,
    a vector add.
  </li>
  <li>
    The llvm.arm.neon.vmovn intrinsic has been removed.  Calls of this intrinsic
    are now replaced by vector truncate operations.
  </li>
  <li>
    The llvm.arm.neon.vmovls and llvm.arm.neon.vmovlu intrinsics have been
    removed.  They are now represented as vector sign-extend (vmovls) and
    zero-extend (vmovlu) operations.
  </li>
  <li>
    The llvm.arm.neon.vaddl*, llvm.arm.neon.vaddw*, llvm.arm.neon.vsubl*, and
    llvm.arm.neon.vsubw* intrinsics (lengthening vector add and subtract) have
    been removed.  They are replaced by vector add and vector subtract operations
    where one (vaddw, vsubw) or both (vaddl, vsubl) of the operands are either
    sign-extended or zero-extended.
  </li>
  <li>
    The llvm.arm.neon.vmulls, llvm.arm.neon.vmullu, llvm.arm.neon.vmlal*, and
    llvm.arm.neon.vmlsl* intrinsics (lengthening vector multiply with and without
    accumulation and subtraction) have been removed.  These operations are now
    represented as vector multiplications where the operands are either
    sign-extended or zero-extended, followed by a vector add for vmlal or a
    vector subtract for vmlsl.  Note that the polynomial vector multiply
    intrinsic, llvm.arm.neon.vmullp, remains unchanged.

<ul>
<li>.ll file doesn't produce #uses comments anymore, to get them, run a .bc file
   through "llvm-dis --show-annotations".</li>
<li>MSIL Backend removed.</li>
<li>ABCD and SSI passes removed.</li>
<li>'Union' LLVM IR feature removed.</li>
<li>SCCVN pass removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, many APIs have changed in this release.  Some of the major LLVM
API changes are:</p>
<ul>

  RegisterPass<> -> INTIALIZE_PASS()



<li>LLVM 2.8 changes the internal order of operands in <a
  href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1InvokeInst.html"><tt>InvokeInst</tt></a>
  and <a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1CallInst.html"><tt>CallInst</tt></a>.
  To be portable across releases, resort to <tt>CallSite</tt> and the
  high-level accessors, such as <tt>getCalledValue</tt> and <tt>setUnwindDest</tt>.
</li>
<li>
  You can no longer pass use_iterators directly to cast<> (and similar), because
  these routines tend to perform costly dereference operations more than once. You
  have to dereference the iterators yourself and pass them in.
</li>
<li>
  llvm.memcpy.*, llvm.memset.*, llvm.memmove.* (and possibly other?) intrinsics
  take an extra parameter now (i1 isVolatile), totaling 5 parameters.
  If you were creating these intrinsic calls and prototypes yourself (as opposed
  to using Intrinsic::getDeclaration), you can use UpgradeIntrinsicFunction/UpgradeIntrinsicCall
  to be portable accross releases.
  Note that you cannot use Intrinsic::getDeclaration() in a backwards compatible
  way (needs 2/3 types now, in 2.7 it needed just 1).
</li>
<li>
  SetCurrentDebugLocation takes a DebugLoc now instead of a MDNode.
  Change your code to use
  SetCurrentDebugLocation(DebugLoc::getFromDILocation(...)).
</li>
<li>
  VISIBILITY_HIDDEN is gone.
</li>
<li>
  The <tt>RegisterPass</tt> and <tt>RegisterAnalysisGroup</tt> templates are
  considered deprecated, but continue to function in LLVM 2.8.  Clients are  
  strongly advised to use the upcoming <tt>INITIALIZE_PASS()</tt> and
  <tt>INITIALIZE_AG_PASS()</tt> macros instead.
<li>
  SMDiagnostic takes different parameters now. //FIXME: how to upgrade?
</li>
<li>
  The constructor for the Triple class no longer tries to understand odd triple
  specifications.  Frontends should ensure that they only pass valid triples to
  LLVM.  The Triple::normalize utility method has been added to help front-ends
  deal with funky triples.
<li>
  Some APIs got renamed:
  <ul>
      <li>llvm_report_error -&gt; report_fatal_error</li>
      <li>llvm_install_error_handler -&gt; install_fatal_error_handler</li>
      <li>llvm::DwarfExceptionHandling -&gt; llvm::JITExceptionHandling</li>
  </ul>
</li>

</ul>

  <a name="llvm-gcc">Known problems with the llvm-gcc front-end</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>llvm-gcc is generally very stable for the C family of languages.  The only
   major language feature of GCC not supported by llvm-gcc is the
   <tt>__builtin_apply</tt> family of builtins.   However, some extensions
   are only supported on some targets.  For example, trampolines are only
   supported on some targets (these are used when you take the address of a
   nested function).</p>

<p>Fortran support generally works, but there are still several unresolved bugs
   in <a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/">Bugzilla</a>.  Please see the
   tools/gfortran component for details.  Note that llvm-gcc is missing major
   Fortran performance work in the frontend and library that went into GCC after
   4.2.  If you are interested in Fortran, we recommend that you consider using
   <a href="#dragonegg">dragonegg</a> instead.</p>

<p>The llvm-gcc 4.2 Ada compiler has basic functionality. However, this is not a
mature technology, and problems should be expected.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Ada front-end currently only builds on X86-32.  This is mainly due
to lack of trampoline support (pointers to nested functions) on other platforms.
However, it <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2006">also fails to build on X86-64</a>
which does support trampolines.</li>
<li>The Ada front-end <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2007">fails to bootstrap</a>.
This is due to lack of LLVM support for <tt>setjmp</tt>/<tt>longjmp</tt> style
exception handling, which is used internally by the compiler.
Workaround: configure with <tt>--disable-bootstrap</tt>.</li>
<li>The c380004, <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a>
and <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2421">cxg2021</a> ACATS tests fail
(c380004 also fails with gcc-4.2 mainline).
If the compiler is built with checks disabled then <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a>
causes the compiler to go into an infinite loop, using up all system memory.</li>
<li>Some GCC specific Ada tests continue to crash the compiler.</li>
<li>The <tt>-E</tt> binder option (exception backtraces)
<a href="http://llvm.org/PR1982">does not work</a> and will result in programs
crashing if an exception is raised.  Workaround: do not use <tt>-E</tt>.</li>
<li>Only discrete types <a href="http://llvm.org/PR1981">are allowed to start
or finish at a non-byte offset</a> in a record.  Workaround: do not pack records
or use representation clauses that result in a field of a non-discrete type
starting or finishing in the middle of a byte.</li>
<li>The <tt>lli</tt> interpreter <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2009">considers
'main' as generated by the Ada binder to be invalid</a>.
Workaround: hand edit the file to use pointers for <tt>argv</tt> and
<tt>envp</tt> rather than integers.</li>
<li>The <tt>-fstack-check</tt> option <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2008">is
ignored</a>.</li>
