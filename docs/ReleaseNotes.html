<p>
The LLVM 2.9 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM
repository (which roughly includes the LLVM optimizers, code generators
and supporting tools), the Clang repository and the llvm-gcc repository.  In
addition to this code, the LLVM Project includes other sub-projects that are in
development.  Here we include updates on these subprojects.
</p>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="clang">Clang: C/C++/Objective-C Frontend Toolkit</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> is an LLVM front end for the C,
C++, and Objective-C languages. Clang aims to provide a better user experience
through expressive diagnostics, a high level of conformance to language
standards, fast compilation, and low memory use. Like LLVM, Clang provides a
modular, library-based architecture that makes it suitable for creating or
integrating with other development tools. Clang is considered a
production-quality compiler for C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ on x86
(32- and 64-bit), and for darwin-arm targets.</p>

<p>In the LLVM 2.9 time-frame, the Clang team has made many improvements:</p>

<ul>
</ul>
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="clangsa">Clang Static Analyzer</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The <a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">Clang Static Analyzer</a>
   project is an effort to use static source code analysis techniques to
   automatically find bugs in C and Objective-C programs (and hopefully <a
   href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/dev_cxx.html">C++ in the
   future</a>!).  The tool is very good at finding bugs that occur on specific
   paths through code, such as on error conditions.</p>

<p>The LLVM 2.9 release... 
</p>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="dragonegg">DragonEgg: llvm-gcc ported to gcc-4.5</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
NOTE: This should be written to be self-contained without referencing llvm-gcc.

<p>
<a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">DragonEgg</a> is a port of llvm-gcc to
gcc-4.5.  Unlike llvm-gcc, dragonegg in theory does not require any gcc-4.5
modifications whatsoever (currently one small patch is needed) thanks to the
new <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/plugins">gcc plugin architecture</a>.
DragonEgg is a gcc plugin that makes gcc-4.5 use the LLVM optimizers and code
generators instead of gcc's, just like with llvm-gcc.
</p>

<p>
DragonEgg is still a work in progress, but it is able to compile a lot of code,
for example all of gcc, LLVM and clang.  Currently Ada, C, C++ and Fortran work
well, while all other languages either don't work at all or only work poorly.
For the moment only the x86-32 and x86-64 targets are supported, and only on
linux and darwin (darwin may need additional gcc patches).
</p>

<p>
The 2.9 release has the following notable changes:
<ul>
</ul>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="vmkit">VMKit: JVM Virtual Machine Implementation</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The <a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org/">VMKit project</a> is an implementation of
a Java Virtual Machine (Java VM or JVM) that uses LLVM for static and
just-in-time compilation.

UPDATE.
</p>
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="compiler-rt">compiler-rt: Compiler Runtime Library</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The new LLVM <a href="http://compiler-rt.llvm.org/">compiler-rt project</a>
is a simple library that provides an implementation of the low-level
target-specific hooks required by code generation and other runtime components.
For example, when compiling for a 32-bit target, converting a double to a 64-bit
unsigned integer is compiled into a runtime call to the "__fixunsdfdi"
function. The compiler-rt library provides highly optimized implementations of
this and other low-level routines (some are 3x faster than the equivalent
libgcc routines).</p>

<p>
All of the code in the compiler-rt project is available under the standard LLVM
License, a "BSD-style" license.  

NEW: MIT License as well.

New in LLVM 2.9,  UPDATE</p>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="lldb">LLDB: Low Level Debugger</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
<a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/">LLDB</a> is a brand new member of the LLVM
umbrella of projects. LLDB is a next generation, high-performance debugger. It
is built as a set of reusable components which highly leverage existing
libraries in the larger LLVM Project, such as the Clang expression parser, the
LLVM disassembler and the LLVM JIT.</p>

<p>
LLDB is in early development and not included as part of the LLVM 2.9 release,
UPDATE!

<!--
but is mature enough to support basic debugging scenarios on Mac OS X in C,
Objective-C and C++.  We'd really like help extending and expanding LLDB to 
support new platforms, new languages, new architectures, and new features.-->
</p>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="libc++">libc++: C++ Standard Library</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
<a href="http://libcxx.llvm.org/">libc++</a> is another new member of the LLVM
family.  It is an implementation of the C++ standard library, written from the
ground up to specifically target the forthcoming C++'0X standard and focus on
delivering great performance.</p>

<p>
As of the LLVM 2.9 release, UPDATE!

<!--libc++ is virtually feature complete, but would
benefit from more testing and better integration with Clang++.  It is also
looking forward to the C++ committee finalizing the C++'0x standard.-->
</p>

</div>



<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="klee">KLEE: A Symbolic Execution Virtual Machine</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
<a href="http://klee.llvm.org/">KLEE</a> is a symbolic execution framework for
programs in LLVM bitcode form. KLEE tries to symbolically evaluate "all" paths
through the application and records state transitions that lead to fault
states. This allows it to construct testcases that lead to faults and can even
be used to verify some algorithms.

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="mc">MC Level Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The LLVM Machine Code (aka MC) subsystem was created to solve a number
of problems in the realm of assembly, disassembly, object file format handling,
and a number of other related areas that CPU instruction-set level tools work
in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>MC is now used by default for ELF systems on x86 and
  x86-64.</li>
  <li>MC supports and CodeGen uses the <tt>.loc</tt> directives for
  producing line number debug info. This produces more compact line
  tables.</li>
  <li>MC supports the <tt>.cfi_*</tt> directives for producing DWARF
  frame information, but it is still not used by CodeGen by default.</li>
  <li>COFF support?</li>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>llvm-gcc is generally very stable for the C family of languages.  The only
   major language feature of GCC not supported by llvm-gcc is the
   <tt>__builtin_apply</tt> family of builtins.   However, some extensions
   are only supported on some targets.  For example, trampolines are only
   supported on some targets (these are used when you take the address of a
   nested function).</p>

<p>Fortran support generally works, but there are still several unresolved bugs
   in <a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/">Bugzilla</a>.  Please see the
   tools/gfortran component for details.  Note that llvm-gcc is missing major
   Fortran performance work in the frontend and library that went into GCC after
   4.2.  If you are interested in Fortran, we recommend that you consider using
   <a href="#dragonegg">dragonegg</a> instead.</p>

<p>The llvm-gcc 4.2 Ada compiler has basic functionality, but is no longer being
actively maintained.  If you are interested in Ada, we recommend that you
consider using <a href="#dragonegg">dragonegg</a> instead.</p>
