<p>
The LLVM 2.4 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM
repository (which roughly includes the LLVM optimizers, code generators and
supporting tools) and the llvm-gcc repository.  In addition to this code, the
LLVM Project includes other sub-projects that are in development.  The two which
are the most actively developed are the <a href="#clang">Clang Project</a> and
the <a href="#vmkit">vmkit Project</a>.

<p>The <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang project</a> is an effort to build
a set of new 'LLVM native' front-end technologies for the LLVM optimizer

areas.  Its C and Objective-C parsing support is very solid, and the code
generation support is far enough along to build many C applications.  While not
yet production quality, it is progressing very nicely.  In addition, C++
front-end work has started to make significant progress.</p>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>This release includes a huge number of bug fixes, performance tweaks and
minor improvements.  Some of the major improvements and new features are listed
in this section.
</p>
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="majorfeatures">Major New Features</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 2.4 includes several major new capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The most visible end-user change in LLVM 2.4 is that it includes many
optimizations and changes ot make -O0 compile times much faster.  You should see
improvements on the order of 30% or more faster than LLVM 2.3.  There are many
pieces to this change, described in more detail below.  The speedups and new
components can also be used for JIT compilers that want fast compilation as
well.</p></li>

<li><p>The biggest change to the LLVM IR is that Multiple Return Values (which
were introduced in LLVM 2.3) have been generalized to full support for "First
Class Aggregate" values in LLVM 2.4.  This means that LLVM IR supports using
structs and arrays as values in a function.  This capability is mostly useful
for front-end authors, who prefer to treat things like complex numbers, simple
tuples, dope vectors, etc as Value*'s instead of as a tuple of Value*'s or as
memory values.</p></li>

<li><p>LLVM 2.4 also includes an initial port for the PIC16 microprocessor. This
is the LLVM targer that only has support for 8 bit registers, and a number of
other crazy constraints.  While the port is still in early development stages,
it shows some interesting things you can do with LLVM.</p></li>

</ul>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="llvm-gcc">llvm-gcc 4.2 Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM fully supports the llvm-gcc 4.2 front-end, which marries the GCC
front-ends and driver with the LLVM optimizer and code generator.  It currently
includes support for the C, C++, Objective-C, Ada, and Fortran front-ends.</p>

<ul>
<li>LLVM 2.4 supports the full set of atomic __sync builtins.  LLVM 2.3 only
supported those used by OpenMP, but 2.4 supports them all.  Not all targets
support all builtins, but X86 and PowerPC do.</li>

<li>llvm-gcc now supports an -flimited-precision option, which tells the
compiler that it is ok to use low-precision approximations of certain libm
functions (like tan, log, etc).  This allows you to get high performance if you
only need (say) 14-bits of precision.</li>

<li>llvm-gcc now supports a C language extension known as "<a 
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-dev/2008-August/002670.html">Blocks
</a>.  This feature is similar to nested functions and closures, but does not
require stack trampolines (with most ABIs) and supports returning closures 
from functions that define them.  Note that actually <em>using</em> Blocks
requires a small runtime that is not included with llvm-gcc.</li>

<li>llvm-gcc now supports a new <tt>-flto</tt> option.  On systems that support
transparent Link Time Optimization (currently Darwin systems with Xcode 3.1 and
later) this allows the use of LTO with other optimization levels like -Os.
Previously, LTO could only be used with -O4, which implied optimizations in
-O3 that can increase code size.</li>
</ul>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="coreimprovements">LLVM Core Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>New features include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>vector shifts in the IR: no codegen support yet</li>
<li>use diet patch landed: saved 15% IR memory footprint</li>
<li>LLVM IR now directly represents "common" linkage, instead of
    representing it as a form of weak linkage.</li>
<li>DebugInfoBuilder</li>
<li>.ll printing format change: %3 = add i32 4, 2</li>
<li>opt-size, noinline, alwaysinline function attributes</li>
<li>Attrs: function, return, param.</p></li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="optimizer">Optimizer Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>In addition to a huge array of bug fixes and minor performance tweaks, the
LLVM 2.4 optimizers support a few major enhancements:</p>

<ul>

<li>GVN now does local PRE?</li>

<li>Matthijs' Dead argument elimination rewrite</li>

<li>Old-ADCE used control dependence and deleted output-free infinite loops.
Added a new Loop deletion pass (for deleting output free provably-finite loops)
and rewrote ADCE to be simpler faster, and not need control dependence.</li>

<li>SparsePropagation framework for lattice-based dataflow solvers.</li>

<li>Tail duplication was removed from the standard optimizer sequence.</li>

<li>Various helper functions (ComputeMaskedBits, ComputeNumSignBits, etc) were
pulled out of instcombine and put into a new ValueTracking.h file, where they
can be reused by other passes.</li>

<li>The new AddReadAttrs pass works out which functions are read-only or
read-none (these correspond to 'pure' and 'const' in C) and marks them
with the appropriate attribute.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="codegen">Code Generator Improvements</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>We put a significant amount of work into the code generator infrastructure,
which allows us to implement more aggressive algorithms and make it run
faster:</p>

<ul>
<li>asm writers split out to their own library to avoid JITs having to link
 them in.</li>
<li>Big asm writer refactoring + TargetAsmInfo</li>
<li>2-addr pass and coalescer can now remat trivial insts to avoid a copy.</li>
<li>spiller to commute instructions in order to fold a reload</li>
<li>Stack slot coloring?</li>
<li>Live intervals renumbering?  Is this useful to external people?</li>
<li>'is as cheap as a move' instruction flag</li>
<li>Improvements to selection dag viewing</li>
<li>fast isel</li>
<li>Selection dag speedups</li>
<li>asmwriter + raw_ostream -> fastah</li>
<li>Partitioned Boolean Quadratic Programming (PBQP) based register

<div class="doc_section">
  <a name="portability">Portability and Supported Platforms</a>
</div>
<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM is known to work on the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel and AMD machines (IA32) running Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core and FreeBSD
      (and probably other unix-like systems).</li>
<li>PowerPC and X86-based Mac OS X systems, running 10.3 and above in 32-bit and
    64-bit modes.</li>
<li>Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 using MinGW libraries (native).</li>
<li>Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 with the Cygwin libraries (limited
    support is available for native builds with Visual C++).</li>
<li>Sun UltraSPARC workstations running Solaris 10.</li>
<li>Alpha-based machines running Debian GNU/Linux.</li>
<li>Itanium-based (IA64) machines running Linux and HP-UX.</li>
</ul>

<p>The core LLVM infrastructure uses GNU autoconf to adapt itself
to the machine and operating system on which it is built.  However, minor
porting may be required to get LLVM to work on new platforms.  We welcome your
portability patches and reports of successful builds or error messages.</p>

</div>

<div class="doc_text">
The llvm-gcc 4.2 Ada compiler works fairly well, however this is not a mature
technology and problems should be expected.
<ul>
<li>The Ada front-end currently only builds on X86-32.  This is mainly due
to lack of trampoline support (pointers to nested functions) on other platforms,
however it <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2006">also fails to build on X86-64</a>
which does support trampolines.</li>
<li>The Ada front-end <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2007">fails to bootstrap</a>.
Workaround: configure with --disable-bootstrap.</li>
<li>The c380004, <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a>
and <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2421">cxg2021</a> ACATS tests fail
(c380004 also fails with gcc-4.2 mainline).</li>
<li>Some gcc specific Ada tests continue to crash the compiler.</li>
<li>The -E binder option (exception backtraces)
<a href="http://llvm.org/PR1982">does not work</a> and will result in programs
crashing if an exception is raised.  Workaround: do not use -E.</li>
<li>Only discrete types <a href="http://llvm.org/PR1981">are allowed to start
or finish at a non-byte offset</a> in a record.  Workaround: do not pack records
or use representation clauses that result in a field of a non-discrete type
starting or finishing in the middle of a byte.</li>
<li>The <tt>lli</tt> interpreter <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2009">considers
'main' as generated by the Ada binder to be invalid</a>.
Workaround: hand edit the file to use pointers for <tt>argv</tt> and
<tt>envp</tt> rather than integers.</li>
<li>The <tt>-fstack-check</tt> option <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2008">is
