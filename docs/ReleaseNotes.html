<p>
The LLVM 2.5 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM
repository (which roughly includes the LLVM optimizers, code generators and
supporting tools) and the llvm-gcc repository.  In addition to this code, the
LLVM Project includes other sub-projects that are in development.  The two which
are the most actively developed are the <a href="#clang">Clang Project</a> and
the <a href="#vmkit">VMKit Project</a>.
</p>

</div>


<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="clang">Clang: C/C++/Objective-C Frontend Toolkit</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang project</a> is an effort to build
a set of new 'LLVM native' front-end technologies for the LLVM optimizer
and code generator.  While Clang is not included in the LLVM 2.5 release, it 
is continuing to make major strides forward in all areas.  Its C and Objective-C
parsing and code generation support is now very solid.  For example, it is
capable of successfully building many real applications for X86-32 and X86-64,
including the FreeBSD kernel.  C++ is also making <a
href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html">incredible progress</a>, and work
on templates has recently started.</p>

<p>While Clang is not yet production quality, it is progressing very nicely and
is quite usable for building many C and Objective-C applications.  If you are
interested in fast compiles and good diagnostics, we encourage you to try it out
by <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html">building from mainline</a>
and reporting any issues you hit to the <a 
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev">Clang front-end mailing
list</a>.</p>

<p>In the LLVM 2.5 time-frame, the Clang team has made many improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clang now has a new driver, which is focused on providing a GCC-compatible
    interface.</li> 
<li>The X86-64 ABI is now supported.</li> 
<li>Precompiled header support is now implemented.</li> 
<li>Objective-C support is significantly improved beyond LLVM 2.4, supporting
    many features, such as Objective-C Garbage Collection.</li>
<li>Many many bugs are fixed.</li>
</div>

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="clangsa">Clang Static Analyzer</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>The Clang project also includes an early stage static source code analysis
tool for <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/StaticAnalysis.html">automatically
finding bugs</a> in C and Objective-C programs. The tool performs a growing set
of checks to find bugs that occur on a specific path within a program.  Examples
of bugs the tool finds include logic errors such as null dereferences,
violations of various API rules, dead code, and potential memory leaks in
Objective-C programs. Since its inception, public feedback on the tool has been
extremely positive, and conservative estimates put the number of real bugs it
has found in industrial-quality software on the order of thousands.</p>

<p>The tool also provides a simple web GUI to inspect potential bugs found by
the tool.  While still early in development, the GUI illustrates some of the key
features of Clang: accurate source location information, which is used by the
GUI to highlight specific code expressions that relate to a bug (including those
that span multiple lines); and built-in knowledge of macros, which is used to
perform inline expansion of macros within the GUI itself.</p>

<p>The set of checks performed by the static analyzer is gradually expanding,
and future plans for the tool include full source-level inter-procedural
analysis and deeper checks such as buffer overrun detection. There are many
opportunities to extend and enhance the static analyzer, and anyone interested
in working on this project is encouraged to get involved!</p>

<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="vmkit">VMKit: JVM/CLI Virtual Machine Implementation</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The <a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org/">VMKit project</a> is an implementation of
a JVM and a CLI Virtual Machines (Microsoft .NET is an
implementation of the CLI) using the Just-In-Time compiler of LLVM.</p>

<p>Following LLVM 2.5, VMKit has its first release ? that you can find on its
<a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org/releases/">webpage</a>. The release includes
bug fixes, cleanup and new features. The major changes are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Ahead of Time compiler: compiles .class files to llvm .bc. VMKit uses this
functionality to native compile the standard classes (eg java.lang.String).
Users can compile AOT .class files into dynamic libraries and run them with the
help of VMKit.</li>

<li>New exception model: the dwarf exception model is very slow for
exception-intensive applications, so the JVM has had a new implementation of
exceptions which check at each function call if an exception happened. There is
a low performance penalty on applications without exceptions, but it is a big
gain for exception-intensive applications. For example the jack benchmark in
Spec JVM98 is 6x faster (performance gain of 83%).</li>

<li>New support for OSX/X64, Linux/X64 (with the Boehm GC), Linux/ppc32.</li>

</ul>

in this section.

<!--=========================================================================-->
<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="majorfeatures">Major New Features</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM 2.5 includes several major new capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The code generator now supports arbitrary precision integers.
Types like <tt>i33</tt> have long been valid in the LLVM IR, but previously
could only be used with the interpreter.
Now IR using such types can be compiled to native code on all targets.
All operations are supported if the integer is not bigger than twice the
target machine word size.
Simple operations like loads, stores and shifts by a constant amount are
supported for integers of any size.
</p></li>

unit test framework based on Google Test.

vector shift support + X86 backend.
x86 JIT now detects core i7 and atom, autoconfiguring itself appropriately.

<li>The type legalization logic has been completely rewritten, and is now
more powerful (it supports arbitrary precision integer types for example)
and hopefully more correct.
The type legalizer converts operations on types that are not natively
supported by the target machine into equivalent code sequences that only use
natively supported types.

  <a name="portability">Portability and Supported Platforms</a>
</div>
<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<div class="doc_text">

<p>LLVM is known to work on the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel and AMD machines (IA32, X86-64, AMD64, EMT-64) running Red Hat 
Linux, Fedora Core and FreeBSD (and probably other unix-like systems).</li>
<li>PowerPC and X86-based Mac OS X systems, running 10.3 and above in 32-bit 
and 64-bit modes.</li>
<li>Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 using MinGW libraries (native).</li>
<li>Intel and AMD machines running on Win32 with the Cygwin libraries (limited
    support is available for native builds with Visual C++).</li>
<li>Sun UltraSPARC workstations running Solaris 10.</li>
<li>Alpha-based machines running Debian GNU/Linux.</li>
<li>Itanium-based (IA64) machines running Linux and HP-UX.</li>
</ul>

<p>The core LLVM infrastructure uses GNU autoconf to adapt itself
to the machine and operating system on which it is built.  However, minor
porting may be required to get LLVM to work on new platforms.  We welcome your
portability patches and reports of successful builds or error messages.</p>

The llvm-gcc 4.2 Ada compiler works fairly well, however this is not a mature
technology and problems should be expected.
<ul>
<li>The Ada front-end currently only builds on X86-32.  This is mainly due
to lack of trampoline support (pointers to nested functions) on other platforms,
however it <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2006">also fails to build on X86-64</a>
which does support trampolines.</li>
<li>The Ada front-end <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2007">fails to bootstrap</a>.
This is due to lack of LLVM support for <tt>setjmp</tt>/<tt>longjmp</tt> style
exception handling, which is used internally by the compiler.
Workaround: configure with --disable-bootstrap.</li>

and <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2421">cxg2021</a> ACATS tests fail
(c380004 also fails with gcc-4.2 mainline).
If the compiler is built with checks disabled then <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a>

<li>Some gcc specific Ada tests continue to crash the compiler.</li>
<li>The -E binder option (exception backtraces)
<a href="http://llvm.org/PR1982">does not work</a> and will result in programs
crashing if an exception is raised.  Workaround: do not use -E.</li>
<li>Only discrete types <a href="http://llvm.org/PR1981">are allowed to start
