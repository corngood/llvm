The LLVM 2.7 distribution currently consists of code from the core LLVM
repository (which roughly includes the LLVM optimizers, code generators
and supporting tools), the Clang repository and the llvm-gcc repository.  In
addition to this code, the LLVM Project includes other sub-projects that are in
development.  Here we include updates on these subprojects.

<ul>
<li>FIXME: C++! Include a link to cxx_compatibility.html</li>

<li>FIXME: Static Analyzer improvements?</li>

<li>CIndex API and Python bindings: Clang now includes a C API as part of the
CIndex library. Although we make make some changes to the API in the future, it
is intended to be stable and has been designed for use by external projects. See
the Clang

<li>ARM Support: Clang now has ABI support for both the Darwin and Linux ARM
ABIs. Coupled with many improvements to the LLVM ARM backend, Clang is now
suitable for use as a a beta quality ARM compiler.</li>

<a name="vmkit">VMKit: JVM/CLI Virtual Machine Implementation</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The <a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org/">VMKit project</a> is an implementation of
a JVM and a CLI Virtual Machine (Microsoft .NET is an
implementation of the CLI) using LLVM for static and just-in-time
compilation.</p>

<p>
With the release of LLVM 2.7, VMKit has shifted to a great framework for writing
virtual machines. VMKit now offers precise and efficient garbage collection with
multi-threading support, thanks to the MMTk memory management toolkit, as well
as just in time and ahead of time compilation with LLVM.  The major changes in
VMKit 0.27 are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Garbage collection: VMKit now uses the MMTk toolkit for garbage collectors.
  The first collector to be ported is the MarkSweep collector, which is precise,
  and drastically improves the performance of VMKit.</li>
<li>Line number information in the JVM: by using the debug metadata of LLVM, the
 JVM now supports precise line number information, useful when printing a stack
 trace.</li>
<li>Interface calls in the JVM: we implemented a variant of the Interface Method
  Table technique for interface calls in the JVM.
</li>

</ul>

<a name="compiler-rt">compiler-rt: Compiler Runtime Library</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
The new LLVM <a href="http://compiler-rt.llvm.org/">compiler-rt project</a>
is a simple library that provides an implementation of the low-level
target-specific hooks required by code generation and other runtime components.
For example, when compiling for a 32-bit target, converting a double to a 64-bit
unsigned integer is compiled into a runtime call to the "__fixunsdfdi"
function. The compiler-rt library provides highly optimized implementations of
this and other low-level routines (some are 3x faster than the equivalent
libgcc routines).</p>

<p>
All of the code in the compiler-rt project is available under the standard LLVM
License, a "BSD-style" license.  New in LLVM 2.7: compiler_rt now
supports ARM targets.</p>

<div class="doc_subsection">
<a name="dragonegg">DragonEgg: llvm-gcc ported to gcc-4.5</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
<p>
<a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">DragonEgg</a> is a port of llvm-gcc to
gcc-4.5.  Unlike llvm-gcc, which makes many intrusive changes to the underlying
gcc-4.2 code, dragonegg in theory does not require any gcc-4.5 modifications
whatsoever (currently one small patch is needed).  This is thanks to the new
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/plugins">gcc plugin architecture</a>, which
makes it possible to modify the behaviour of gcc at runtime by loading a plugin,
which is nothing more than a dynamic library which conforms to the gcc plugin
interface.  DragonEgg is a gcc plugin that causes the LLVM optimizers to be run
instead of the gcc optimizers, and the LLVM code generators instead of the gcc
code generators, just like llvm-gcc.  To use it, you add
"-fplugin=path/dragonegg.so" to the gcc-4.5 command line, and gcc-4.5 magically
becomes llvm-gcc-4.5!
</p>

<p>
DragonEgg is still a work in progress.  Currently C works very well, while C++,
Ada and Fortran work fairly well.  All other languages either don't work at all,
or only work poorly.  For the moment only the x86-32 and x86-64 targets are
supported, and only on linux and darwin (darwin needs an additional gcc patch).
</p>

<p>
The first dragonegg release will occur shortly after llvm-2.7 is released.

Programs are collections of equations which are used to evaluate expressions in
a symbolic fashion. Pure offers dynamic typing, eager and lazy evaluation,
lexical closures, a hygienic macro system (also based on term rewriting),
built-in list and matrix support (including list and matrix comprehensions) and
an easy-to-use C interface. The interpreter uses LLVM as a backend to
 JIT-compile Pure programs to fast native code.</p>

programs down to synthesizable VHDL and parallel program binaries. Processor
customization points include the register files, function units, supported
operations, and the interconnection network.</p>

<p>TCE uses llvm-gcc/Clang and LLVM for C/C++ language support, target
independent optimizations and also for parts of code generation. It generates
new LLVM-based code generators "on the fly" for the designed TTA processors and
loads them in to the compiler backend as runtime libraries to avoid per-target
recompilation of larger parts of the compiler chain.</p>

<a name="changes">Major Changes and Removed Features</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<p>If you're already an LLVM user or developer with out-of-tree changes based
on LLVM 2.6, this section lists some "gotchas" that you may run into upgrading
from the previous release.</p>

<ul>

<li>
The Andersen's alias analysis ("anders-aa") pass, the Predicate Simplifier
("predsimplify") pass, the LoopVR pass, the GVNPRE pass, and the random sampling
profiling ("rsprofiling") passes have all been removed.  They were not being
actively maintained and had substantial problems.  If you are interested in
these components, you are welcome to ressurect them from SVN, fix the
correctness problems, and resubmit them to mainline.</li>

<li>LLVM now defaults to building most libraries with RTTI turned off, providing
a code size reduction.  Packagers who are interested in building LLVM to support
plugins that require RTTI information should build with "make REQUIRE_RTTI=1"
and should read the new <a href="Packaging.html">Advice on Packaging LLVM</a>
document.</li>

<li>The LLVM interpreter now defaults to <em>not</em> using <tt>libffi</tt> even
if you have it installed.  This makes it more likely that an LLVM built on one
system will work when copied to a similar system.  To use <tt>libffi</tt>,
configure with <tt>--enable-libffi</tt></li>.

<li>Debug information uses a completely different representation, an LLVM 2.6
.bc file should work with LLVM 2.7, but debug info won't come forward.</li>

<li>The LLVM 2.6 (and earlier) "malloc" and "free" instructions got removed,
    along with LowerAllocations pass.  Now you should just use a call to the
    malloc and free functions in libc.  These calls are optimized as well as
    the old instructions were.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, many APIs have changed in this release.  Some of the major LLVM
API changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Just about everything has been converted to use raw_ostream instead of
    std::ostream.</li>
<li>llvm/ADT/iterator.h has been removed, just use &lt;iterator&gt;
 instead.</li>
<li>The Streams.h file and "DOUT" got removed, use "DEBUG(errs() &lt;&lt; ...);"
   instead.</li>
<li><tt>ModuleProvider</tt> has been <a
href="http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project?view=rev&revision=94686">removed</a>
and its methods moved to <tt>Module</tt> and <tt>GlobalValue</tt>.
Most clients can remove uses of <tt>ExistingModuleProvider</tt>,
replace <tt>getBitcodeModuleProvider</tt> with
<tt>getLazyBitcodeModule</tt>, and pass their <tt>Module</tt> to
functions that used to accept <tt>ModuleProvider</tt>.  Clients who
wrote their own <tt>ModuleProvider</tt>s will need to derive from
<tt>GVMaterializer</tt> instead and use
<tt>Module::setMaterializer</tt> to attach it to a
<tt>Module</tt>.</li>

<li><tt>GhostLinkage</tt> has given up the ghost.
<tt>GlobalValue</tt>s that have not yet been read from their backing
storage have the same linkage they will have after being read in.
Clients must replace calls to
<tt>GlobalValue::hasNotBeenReadFromBitcode</tt> with
<tt>GlobalValue::isMaterializable</tt>.</li>

<li>The <tt>llvm/Support/DataTypes.h</tt> header has moved
to <tt>llvm/System/DataTypes.h</tt>.</li>

<li>The <tt>isInteger</tt>, <tt>isIntOrIntVector</tt>, <tt>isFloatingPoint</tt>,
<tt>isFPOrFPVector</tt> and <tt>isFPOrFPVector</tt> methods have been renamed
<tt>isIntegerTy</tt>, <tt>isIntOrIntVectorTy</tt>, <tt>isFloatingPointTy</tt>, 
<tt>isFPOrFPVectorTy</tt> and <tt>isFPOrFPVectorTy</tt> respectively.</li>

<p>The following components of this LLVM release are either untested, known to
be broken or unreliable, or are in early development.  These components should
not be relied on, and bugs should not be filed against them, but they may be
useful to some people.  In particular, if you would like to work on one of these
components, please contact us on the <a
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">LLVMdev list</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The MSIL, Alpha, SPU, MIPS, PIC16, Blackfin, MSP430, SystemZ and MicroBlaze
    backends are experimental.</li>
<li>The <tt>llc</tt> "<tt>-filetype=asm</tt>" (the default) is the only
    supported value for this option.  The MachO writer is experimental, and
    works much better in mainline SVN.</li>

  <a name="x86-be">Known problems with the X86 back-end</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">

<ul>
  <li>The X86 backend does not yet support
    all <a href="http://llvm.org/PR879">inline assembly that uses the X86
    floating point stack</a>.  It supports the 'f' and 't' constraints, but not
    'u'.</li>
  <li>The X86 backend generates inefficient floating point code when configured
    to generate code for systems that don't have SSE2.</li>
  <li>Win64 code generation wasn't widely tested. Everything should work, but we
    expect small issues to happen. Also, llvm-gcc cannot build the mingw64
    runtime currently due
    to <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2255">several</a>
    <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2257">bugs</a> and due to lack of support for
    the
    'u' inline assembly constraint and for X87 floating point inline assembly.</li>
  <li>The X86-64 backend does not yet support the LLVM IR instruction
      <tt>va_arg</tt>. Currently, the llvm-gcc and front-ends support variadic
      argument constructs on X86-64 by lowering them manually.</li>

<p>The only major language feature of GCC not supported by llvm-gcc is
    the <tt>__builtin_apply</tt> family of builtins.   However, some extensions

    supported on some targets (these are used when you take the address of a
    nested function).</p>

  <a name="ada-fe">Known problems with the llvm-gcc Ada front-end</a>
</div>

<div class="doc_text">
The llvm-gcc 4.2 Ada compiler works fairly well; however, this is not a mature
technology, and problems should be expected.
<ul>
<li>The Ada front-end currently only builds on X86-32.  This is mainly due
to lack of trampoline support (pointers to nested functions) on other platforms.
However, it <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2006">also fails to build on X86-64</a>
which does support trampolines.</li>
<li>The Ada front-end <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2007">fails to bootstrap</a>.
This is due to lack of LLVM support for <tt>setjmp</tt>/<tt>longjmp</tt> style
exception handling, which is used internally by the compiler.
Workaround: configure with <tt>--disable-bootstrap</tt>.</li>
<li>The c380004, <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a>
and <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2421">cxg2021</a> ACATS tests fail
(c380004 also fails with gcc-4.2 mainline).
If the compiler is built with checks disabled then <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2010">c393010</a>
causes the compiler to go into an infinite loop, using up all system memory.</li>
<li>Some GCC specific Ada tests continue to crash the compiler.</li>
<li>The <tt>-E</tt> binder option (exception backtraces)
<a href="http://llvm.org/PR1982">does not work</a> and will result in programs
crashing if an exception is raised.  Workaround: do not use <tt>-E</tt>.</li>
<li>Only discrete types <a href="http://llvm.org/PR1981">are allowed to start
or finish at a non-byte offset</a> in a record.  Workaround: do not pack records
or use representation clauses that result in a field of a non-discrete type
starting or finishing in the middle of a byte.</li>
<li>The <tt>lli</tt> interpreter <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2009">considers
'main' as generated by the Ada binder to be invalid</a>.
Workaround: hand edit the file to use pointers for <tt>argv</tt> and
<tt>envp</tt> rather than integers.</li>
<li>The <tt>-fstack-check</tt> option <a href="http://llvm.org/PR2008">is
ignored</a>.</li>
