@section main_intro Introduction
Welcome to the Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM).

<br>
This documentation describes the @b internal software that makes 
up LLVM, not the @b external use of  LLVM. There are no instructions
here on how to use LLVM, only the APIs that make up the software. For usage 
instructions, please see the programmer's guide or reference manual.

@section main_caveat Caveat 
This documentation is generated directly from the source code with doxygen. 
Since LLVM is constantly under active development, what you're about to
read is out of date! However, it may still be useful since certain portions
of LLVM are very stable.
