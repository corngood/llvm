<p>This document is another way to learn about LLVM. Unlike the 
<a href="LangRef.html">LLVM Reference Manual</a> or 
<a href="ProgrammersManual.html">LLVM Programmer's Manual</a>, here we learn
about LLVM through the experience of creating a simple programming language
named Stacker.  Stacker was invented specifically as a demonstration of
LLVM. The emphasis in this document is not on describing the
intricacies of LLVM itself but on how to use it to build your own
compiler system.</p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_section"> <a name="introduction">Introduction</a> </div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>Amongst other things, LLVM is a platform for compiler writers.
Because of its exceptionally clean and small IR (intermediate
representation), compiler writing with LLVM is much easier than with
other system. As proof, I wrote the entire compiler (language definition, 
lexer, parser, code generator, etc.) in about <em>four days</em>! 
That's important to know because it shows how quickly you can get a new
language running when using LLVM. Furthermore, this was the <em >first</em> 
language the author ever created using LLVM. The learning curve is 
included in that four days.</p>
<p>The language described here, Stacker, is Forth-like. Programs
are simple collections of word definitions, and the only thing definitions
can do is manipulate a stack or generate I/O.  Stacker is not a "real" 
programming language; it's very simple.  Although it is computationally 
complete, you wouldn't use it for your next big project. However, 
the fact that it is complete, it's simple, and it <em>doesn't</em> have 
a C-like syntax make it useful for demonstration purposes. It shows
that LLVM could be applied to a wide variety of languages.</p>
<p>The basic notions behind stacker is very simple. There's a stack of 
integers (or character pointers) that the program manipulates. Pretty 
much the only thing the program can do is manipulate the stack and do 
some limited I/O operations. The language provides you with several 
built-in words that manipulate the stack in interesting ways. To get 
your feet wet, here's how you write the traditional "Hello, World" 
program in Stacker:</p>
<p><code>: hello_world "Hello, World!" &gt;s DROP CR ;<br>
: MAIN hello_world ;<br></code></p>
<p>This has two "definitions" (Stacker manipulates words, not
functions and words have definitions): <code>MAIN</code> and <code>
hello_world</code>. The <code>MAIN</code> definition is standard; it
tells Stacker where to start. Here, <code>MAIN</code> is defined to 
simply invoke the word <code>hello_world</code>. The
<code>hello_world</code> definition tells stacker to push the 
<code>"Hello, World!"</code> string on to the stack, print it out 
(<code>&gt;s</code>), pop it off the stack (<code>DROP</code>), and
finally print a carriage return (<code>CR</code>). Although 
<code>hello_world</code> uses the stack, its net effect is null. Well
written Stacker definitions have that characteristic. </p>
<p>Exercise for the reader: how could you make this a one line program?</p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_section"><a name="lessons"></a>Lessons I Learned About LLVM</div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>Stacker was written for two purposes: </p>
<ol>
    <li>to get the author over the learning curve, and</li>
    <li>to provide a simple example of how to write a compiler using LLVM.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the development of Stacker, many lessons about LLVM were
learned. Those lessons are described in the following subsections.<p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="value"></a>Everything's a Value!</div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>Although I knew that LLVM uses a Single Static Assignment (SSA) format, 
it wasn't obvious to me how prevalent this idea was in LLVM until I really
started using it.  Reading the <a href="ProgrammersManual.html">
Programmer's Manual</a> and <a href="LangRef.html">Language Reference</a>,
I noted that most of the important LLVM IR (Intermediate Representation) C++ 
classes were derived from the Value class. The full power of that simple
design only became fully understood once I started constructing executable
expressions for Stacker.</p>

<p>This really makes your programming go faster. Think about compiling code
for the following C/C++ expression: <code>(a|b)*((x+1)/(y+1))</code>. Assuming
the values are on the stack in the order a, b, x, y, this could be
expressed in stacker as: <code>1 + SWAP 1 + / ROT2 OR *</code>.
You could write a function using LLVM that computes this expression like 
this: </p>

<div class="doc_code"><pre>
Value* 
expression(BasicBlock* bb, Value* a, Value* b, Value* x, Value* y )
{
    ConstantInt* one = ConstantInt::get(Type::IntTy, 1);
    BinaryOperator* or1 = BinaryOperator::createOr(a, b, "", bb);
    BinaryOperator* add1 = BinaryOperator::createAdd(x, one, "", bb);
    BinaryOperator* add2 = BinaryOperator::createAdd(y, one, "", bb);
    BinaryOperator* div1 = BinaryOperator::createDiv(add1, add2, "", bb);
    BinaryOperator* mult1 = BinaryOperator::createMul(or1, div1, "", bb);
    return mult1;
}
</pre></div>

<p>"Okay, big deal," you say?  It is a big deal. Here's why. Note that I didn't
have to tell this function which kinds of Values are being passed in. They could be
<code>Instruction</code>s, <code>Constant</code>s, <code>GlobalVariable</code>s, or
any of the other subclasses of <code>Value</code> that LLVM supports.
Furthermore, if you specify Values that are incorrect for this sequence of 
operations, LLVM will either notice right away (at compilation time) or the LLVM 
Verifier will pick up the inconsistency when the compiler runs. In either case 
LLVM prevents you from making a type error that gets passed through to the 
generated program.  This <em>really</em> helps you write a compiler that 
always generates correct code!<p>
<p>The second point is that we don't have to worry about branching, registers,
stack variables, saving partial results, etc. The instructions we create 
<em>are</em> the values we use. Note that all that was created in the above
code is a Constant value and five operators. Each of the instructions <em>is</em> 
the resulting value of that instruction. This saves a lot of time.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: <em>SSA form is very powerful: there is no difference
between a value and the instruction that created it.</em> This is fully
enforced by the LLVM IR. Use it to your best advantage.</p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="terminate"></a>Terminate Those Blocks!</div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>I had to learn about terminating blocks the hard way: using the debugger 
to figure out what the LLVM verifier was trying to tell me and begging for
help on the LLVMdev mailing list. I hope you avoid this experience.</p>
<p>Emblazon this rule in your mind:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>All</em> <code>BasicBlock</code>s in your compiler <b>must</b> be
	terminated with a terminating instruction (branch, return, etc.).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Terminating instructions are a semantic requirement of the LLVM IR. There
is no facility for implicitly chaining together blocks placed into a function
in the order they occur. Indeed, in the general case, blocks will not be
added to the function in the order of execution because of the recursive
way compilers are written.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you don't terminate your blocks, your compiler code will 
compile just fine. You won't find out about the problem until you're running 
the compiler and the module you just created fails on the LLVM Verifier.</p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="blocks"></a>Concrete Blocks</div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>After a little initial fumbling around, I quickly caught on to how blocks
should be constructed. In general, here's what I learned:
<ol>
    <li><em>Create your blocks early.</em> While writing your compiler, you 
    will encounter several situations where you know apriori that you will
    need several blocks. For example, if-then-else, switch, while, and for
    statements in C/C++ all need multiple blocks for expression in LVVM. 
    The rule is, create them early.</li>
    <li><em>Terminate your blocks early.</em> This just reduces the chances 
    that you forget to terminate your blocks which is required (go 
    <a href="#terminate">here</a> for more). 
    <li><em>Use getTerminator() for instruction insertion.</em> I noticed early on
    that many of the constructors for the Instruction classes take an optional
    <code>insert_before</code> argument. At first, I thought this was a mistake
    because clearly the normal mode of inserting instructions would be one at
    a time <em>after</em> some other instruction, not <em>before</em>. However,
    if you hold on to your terminating instruction (or use the handy dandy
    <code>getTerminator()</code> method on a <code>BasicBlock</code>), it can
    always be used as the <code>insert_before</code> argument to your instruction
    constructors. This causes the instruction to automatically be inserted in 
    the RightPlace&trade; place, just before the terminating instruction. The 
    nice thing about this design is that you can pass blocks around and insert 
    new instructions into them without ever knowing what instructions came 
    before. This makes for some very clean compiler design.</li>
</ol>
<p>The foregoing is such an important principal, its worth making an idiom:</p>
<pre>
BasicBlock* bb = new BasicBlock();
bb->getInstList().push_back( new Branch( ... ) );
new Instruction(..., bb->getTerminator() );
</pre>
<p>To make this clear, consider the typical if-then-else statement
(see StackerCompiler::handle_if() method).  We can set this up
in a single function using LLVM in the following way: </p>
<pre>
using namespace llvm;
BasicBlock*
MyCompiler::handle_if( BasicBlock* bb, SetCondInst* condition )
{
    // Create the blocks to contain code in the structure of if/then/else
    BasicBlock* then_bb = new BasicBlock(); 
    BasicBlock* else_bb = new BasicBlock();
    BasicBlock* exit_bb = new BasicBlock();

    // Insert the branch instruction for the "if"
    bb->getInstList().push_back( new BranchInst( then_bb, else_bb, condition ) );

    // Set up the terminating instructions
    then->getInstList().push_back( new BranchInst( exit_bb ) );
    else->getInstList().push_back( new BranchInst( exit_bb ) );

    // Fill in the then part .. details excised for brevity
    this->fill_in( then_bb );

    // Fill in the else part .. details excised for brevity
    this->fill_in( else_bb );

    // Return a block to the caller that can be filled in with the code
    // that follows the if/then/else construct.
    return exit_bb;
}
</pre>
<p>Presumably in the foregoing, the calls to the "fill_in" method would add 
the instructions for the "then" and "else" parts. They would use the third part
of the idiom almost exclusively (inserting new instructions before the 
terminator). Furthermore, they could even recurse back to <code>handle_if</code> 
should they encounter another if/then/else statement, and it will just work.</p>
<p>Note how cleanly this all works out. In particular, the push_back methods on
the <code>BasicBlock</code>'s instruction list. These are lists of type 
<code>Instruction</code> (which is also of type <code>Value</code>). To create 
the "if" branch we merely instantiate a <code>BranchInst</code> that takes as 
arguments the blocks to branch to and the condition to branch on. The 
<code>BasicBlock</code> objects act like branch labels! This new 
<code>BranchInst</code> terminates the <code>BasicBlock</code> provided 
as an argument. To give the caller a way to keep inserting after calling 
<code>handle_if</code>, we create an <code>exit_bb</code> block which is
returned 
to the caller.  Note that the <code>exit_bb</code> block is used as the 
terminator for both the <code>then_bb</code> and the <code>else_bb</code>
blocks. This guarantees that no matter what else <code>handle_if</code>
or <code>fill_in</code> does, they end up at the <code>exit_bb</code> block.
</p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="push_back"></a>push_back Is Your Friend</div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>
One of the first things I noticed is the frequent use of the "push_back"
method on the various lists. This is so common that it is worth mentioning.
The "push_back" inserts a value into an STL list, vector, array, etc. at the
end. The method might have also been named "insert_tail" or "append".
Although I've used STL quite frequently, my use of push_back wasn't very
high in other programs. In LLVM, you'll use it all the time.
</p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="gep"></a>The Wily GetElementPtrInst</div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>
It took a little getting used to and several rounds of postings to the LLVM
mailing list to wrap my head around this instruction correctly. Even though I had
read the Language Reference and Programmer's Manual a couple times each, I still
missed a few <em>very</em> key points:
</p>
<ul>
<li>GetElementPtrInst gives you back a Value for the last thing indexed.</li>
<li>All global variables in LLVM  are <em>pointers</em>.</li>
<li>Pointers must also be dereferenced with the GetElementPtrInst
instruction.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that when you look up an element in the global variable (assuming
it's a struct or array), you <em>must</em> deference the pointer first! For many
things, this leads to the idiom:
</p>
<pre>
std::vector&lt;Value*&gt; index_vector;
index_vector.push_back( ConstantInt::get( Type::LongTy, 0 );
// ... push other indices ...
GetElementPtrInst* gep = new GetElementPtrInst( ptr, index_vector );
</pre>
<p>For example, suppose we have a global variable whose type is [24 x int]. The
variable itself represents a <em>pointer</em> to that array. To subscript the
array, we need two indices, not just one. The first index (0) dereferences the
pointer. The second index subscripts the array. If you're a "C" programmer, this
will run against your grain because you'll naturally think of the global array
variable and the address of its first element as the same. That tripped me up
for a while until I realized that they really do differ .. by <em>type</em>.
Remember that LLVM is strongly typed. Everything has a type.  
The "type" of the global variable is [24 x int]*. That is, it's
a pointer to an array of 24 ints.  When you dereference that global variable with
a single (0) index, you now have a "[24 x int]" type.  Although
the pointer value of the dereferenced global and the address of the zero'th element
in the array will be the same, they differ in their type. The zero'th element has
type "int" while the pointer value has type "[24 x int]".</p>
<p>Get this one aspect of LLVM right in your head, and you'll save yourself
a lot of compiler writing headaches down the road.</p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="linkage"></a>Getting Linkage Types Right</div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>Linkage types in LLVM can be a little confusing, especially if your compiler
writing mind has affixed firm concepts to particular words like "weak",
"external", "global", "linkonce", etc. LLVM does <em>not</em> use the precise
definitions of, say, ELF or GCC, even though they share common terms. To be fair,
the concepts are related and similar but not precisely the same. This can lead
you to think you know what a linkage type represents but in fact it is slightly
different. I recommend you read the 
<a href="LangRef.html#linkage"> Language Reference on this topic</a> very 
carefully. Then, read it again.<p>
<p>Here are some handy tips that I discovered along the way:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Uninitialized means external.</em> That is, the symbol is declared in the current
    module and can be used by that module, but it is not defined by that module.</li>
    <li><em>Setting an initializer changes a global' linkage type.</em> Setting an 
    initializer changes a global's linkage type from whatever it was to a normal, 
    defined global (not external). You'll need to call the setLinkage() method to 
    reset it if you specify the initializer after the GlobalValue has been constructed. 
    This is important for LinkOnce and Weak linkage types.</li> 
    <li><em>Appending linkage can keep track of things.</em> Appending linkage can 
    be used to keep track of compilation information at runtime. It could be used, 
    for example, to build a full table of all the C++ virtual tables or hold the 
    C++ RTTI data, or whatever. Appending linkage can only be applied to arrays. 
    All arrays with the same name in each module are concatenated together at link 
    time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="constants"></a>Constants Are Easier Than That!</div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>
Constants in LLVM took a little getting used to until I discovered a few utility
functions in the LLVM IR that make things easier. Here's what I learned: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Constants are Values like anything else and can be operands of instructions</li>
 <li>Integer constants, frequently needed, can be created using the static "get"
 methods of the ConstantInt class. The nice thing about these is that you can 
 "get" any kind of integer quickly.</li>
 <li>There's a special method on Constant class which allows you to get the null
 constant for <em>any</em> type. This is really handy for initializing large 
 arrays or structures, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_section"> <a name="lexicon">The Stacker Lexicon</a></div>
<div class="doc_text"><p>This section describes the Stacker language</p></div>
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="stack"></a>The Stack</div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>Stacker definitions define what they do to the global stack. Before
proceeding, a few words about the stack are in order. The stack is simply
a global array of 32-bit integers or pointers. A global index keeps track
of the location of the top of the stack. All of this is hidden from the 
programmer, but it needs to be noted because it is the foundation of the 
conceptual programming model for Stacker. When you write a definition,
you are, essentially, saying how you want that definition to manipulate
the global stack.</p>
<p>Manipulating the stack can be quite hazardous. There is no distinction
given and no checking for the various types of values that can be placed
on the stack. Automatic coercion between types is performed. In many 
cases, this is useful. For example, a boolean value placed on the stack
can be interpreted as an integer with good results. However, using a
word that interprets that boolean value as a pointer to a string to
print out will almost always yield a crash. Stacker simply leaves it
to the programmer to get it right without any interference or hindering
on interpretation of the stack values. You've been warned. :) </p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"> <a name="punctuation"></a>Punctuation</div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>Punctuation in Stacker is very simple. The colon and semi-colon 
characters are used to introduce and terminate a definition
(respectively). Except for <em>FORWARD</em> declarations, definitions 
are all you can specify in Stacker.  Definitions are read left to right. 
Immediately after the colon comes the name of the word being defined. 
The remaining words in the definition specify what the word does. The definition
is terminated by a semi-colon.</p>
<p>So, your typical definition will have the form:</p>
<pre><code>: name ... ;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>name</code> is up to you but it must start with a letter and contain
only letters, numbers, and underscore. Names are case sensitive and must not be
the same as the name of a built-in word. The <code>...</code> is replaced by
the stack manipulating words that you wish to define <code>name</code> as. <p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="comments"></a>Comments</div>
<div class="doc_text">
    <p>Stacker supports two types of comments. A hash mark (#) starts a comment
    that extends to the end of the line. It is identical to the kind of comments
    commonly used in shell scripts. A pair of parentheses also surround a comment.
    In both cases, the content of the comment is ignored by the Stacker compiler. The
    following does nothing in Stacker.
    </p>
<pre><code>
# This is a comment to end of line
( This is an enclosed comment )
</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="#example">example</a> program to see comments in use in 
a real program.</p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="literals"></a>Literals</div>
<div class="doc_text">
    <p>There are three kinds of literal values in Stacker: Integers, Strings,
    and Booleans. In each case, the stack operation is to simply push the
    value on to the stack. So, for example:<br/>
    <code> 42 " is the answer." TRUE </code><br/>
    will push three values on to the stack: the integer 42, the
    string " is the answer.", and the boolean TRUE.</p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="words"></a>Words</div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>Each definition in Stacker is composed of a set of words. Words are
read and executed in order from left to right. There is very little
checking in Stacker to make sure you're doing the right thing with 
the stack. It is assumed that the programmer knows how the stack 
transformation he applies will affect the program.</p>
<p>Words in a definition come in two flavors: built-in and programmer
defined. Simply mentioning the name of a previously defined or declared
programmer-defined word causes that word's stack actions to be invoked. It
is somewhat like a function call in other languages. The built-in
words have various effects, described <a href="#builtins">below</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need to call a word before it is defined. For this, you can
use the <code>FORWARD</code> declaration. It looks like this:</p>
<p><code>FORWARD name ;</code></p>
<p>This simply states to Stacker that "name" is the name of a definition
that is defined elsewhere. Generally it means the definition can be found
"forward" in the file. But, it doesn't have to be in the current compilation
unit. Anything declared with <code>FORWARD</code> is an external symbol for
linking.</p>

<p>TODO</p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="builtins"></a>Built In Words</div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>The built-in words of the Stacker language are put in several groups 
depending on what they do. The groups are as follows:</p>
<ol> 
    <li><em>Logical</em>: These words provide the logical operations for
    comparing stack operands.<br/>The words are: &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;= 
    = &lt;&gt; true false.</li>
    <li><em>Bitwise</em>: These words perform bitwise computations on 
    their operands. <br/> The words are: &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; XOR AND NOT</li>
    <li><em>Arithmetic</em>: These words perform arithmetic computations on
    their operands. <br/> The words are: ABS NEG + - * / MOD */ ++ -- MIN MAX</li>
    <li><em>Stack</em>These words manipulate the stack directly by moving
    its elements around.<br/> The words are: DROP DROP2 NIP NIP2 DUP DUP2 
    SWAP SWAP2 OVER OVER2 ROT ROT2 RROT RROT2 TUCK TUCK2 PICK SELECT ROLL</li>
    <li><em>Memory</em>These words allocate, free, and manipulate memory
    areas outside the stack.<br/>The words are: MALLOC FREE GET PUT</li>
    <li><em>Control</em>: These words alter the normal left to right flow
    of execution.<br/>The words are: IF ELSE ENDIF WHILE END RETURN EXIT RECURSE</li>
    <li><em>I/O</em>: These words perform output on the standard output
    and input on the standard input. No other I/O is possible in Stacker.
    <br/>The words are: SPACE TAB CR &gt;s &gt;d &gt;c &lt;s &lt;d &lt;c.</li>
</ol>
<p>While you may be familiar with many of these operations from other
programming languages, a careful review of their semantics is important
for correct programming in Stacker. Of most importance is the effect 
that each of these built-in words has on the global stack. The effect is
not always intuitive. To better describe the effects, we'll borrow from Forth the idiom of
describing the effect on the stack with:</p>
<p><code> BEFORE -- AFTER </code></p> 
<p>That is, to the left of the -- is a representation of the stack before
the operation. To the right of the -- is a representation of the stack
after the operation. In the table below that describes the operation of
each of the built in words, we will denote the elements of the stack 
using the following construction:</p>

	<code>10 WHILE &gt;d -- END</code><br/>

        the stack (10) is printed out with &gt;d. The top of the stack is 
        decremented, yielding 9 and control is transfered back to the WHILE 
        keyword. The process starts all over again and repeats until
        the top of stack is decremented to 0 at which point the WHILE test 
        fails and control is transfered to the word after the END.

<p>The following fully documented program highlights many features of both
the Stacker language and what is possible with LLVM. The program has two modes
of operation. If you provide numeric arguments to the program, it checks to see
if those arguments are prime numbers and prints out the results. Without any 
arguments, the program prints out any prime numbers it finds between 1 and one 
million (there's a lot of them!). The source code comments below tell the 
remainder of the story.

<div class="doc_text">
<p>As you may have noted from a careful inspection of the Built-In word
definitions, the ROLL word is not implemented. This word was left out of 
Stacker on purpose so that it can be an exercise for the student.  The exercise 
is to implement the ROLL functionality (in your own workspace) and build a test 
program for it.  If you can implement ROLL, you understand Stacker and probably 
a fair amount about LLVM since this is one of the more complicated Stacker 
operations. The work will almost be completely limited to the 
<a href="#compiler">compiler</a>.  
<p>The ROLL word is already recognized by both the lexer and parser but ignored 
by the compiler. That means you don't have to futz around with figuring out how
to get the keyword recognized. It already is.  The part of the compiler that
you need to implement is the <code>ROLL</code> case in the 
<code>StackerCompiler::handle_word(int)</code> method.</p> See the
implementations of PICK and SELECT in the same method to get some hints about
how to complete this exercise.<p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
</div>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div class="doc_subsection"><a name="todo">Things Remaining To Be Done</a></div>
<div class="doc_text">
<p>The initial implementation of Stacker has several deficiencies. If you're
interested, here are some things that could be implemented better:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Write an LLVM pass to compute the correct stack depth needed by the
    program. Currently the stack is set to a fixed number which means programs
    with large numbers of definitions might fail.</li>
    <li>Write an LLVM pass to optimize the use of the global stack. The code
    emitted currently is somewhat wasteful. It gets cleaned up a lot by existing
    passes but more could be done.</li>
    <li>Make the compiler driver use the LLVM linking facilities (with IPO)
    before depending on GCC to do the final link.</li>
    <li>Clean up parsing. It doesn't handle errors very well.</li>
    <li>Rearrange the StackerCompiler.cpp code to make better use of inserting
    instructions before a block's terminating instruction. I didn't figure this
    technique out until I was nearly done with LLVM. As it is, its a bad example
    of how to insert instructions!</li>
    <li>Provide for I/O to arbitrary files instead of just stdin/stdout.</li>
    <li>Write additional built-in words; with inspiration from FORTH</li>
    <li>Write additional sample Stacker programs.</li>
    <li>Add your own compiler writing experiences and tips in the 
    <a href="#lessons">Lessons I Learned About LLVM</a> section.</li>
</ol>
