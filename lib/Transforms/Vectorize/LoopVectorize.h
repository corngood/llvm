//
// This is the LLVM loop vectorizer. This pass modifies 'vectorizable' loops
// and generates target-independent LLVM-IR. Legalization of the IR is done
// in the codegen. However, the vectorizes uses (will use) the codegen
// interfaces to generate IR that is likely to result in an optimal binary.
//
// The loop vectorizer combines consecutive loop iteration into a single
// 'wide' iteration. After this transformation the index is incremented
// by the SIMD vector width, and not by one.
//
// This pass has three parts:
// 1. The main loop pass that drives the different parts.
// 2. LoopVectorizationLegality - A unit that checks for the legality
//    of the vectorization.
// 3. InnerLoopVectorizer - A unit that performs the actual
//    widening of instructions.
// 4. LoopVectorizationCostModel - A unit that checks for the profitability
//    of vectorization. It decides on the optimal vector width, which
//    can be one, if vectorization is not profitable.
//
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//
//
// The reduction-variable vectorization is based on the paper:
//  D. Nuzman and R. Henderson. Multi-platform Auto-vectorization.
//
// Variable uniformity checks are inspired by:
// Karrenberg, R. and Hack, S. Whole Function Vectorization.
//
// Other ideas/concepts are from:
//  A. Zaks and D. Nuzman. Autovectorization in GCC-two years later.
//
//  S. Maleki, Y. Gao, M. Garzaran, T. Wong and D. Padua.  An Evaluation of
//  Vectorizing Compilers.
