* Condition codes
** DONE Problem with asymmetric SETCC operations
The instruction

  CC = R0 < 2

is not symmetric - there is no R0 > 2 instruction. On the other hand, IF CC
JUMP can take both CC and !CC as a condition. We cannot pattern-match (brcond
(not cc), target), the DAG optimizer removes that kind of thing.

This is handled by creating a pseudo-register NCC that aliases CC. Register
classes JustCC and NotCC are used to control the inversion of CC.

** DONE CC as an i32 register
The AnyCC register class pretends to hold i32 values. It can only represent the
values 0 and 1, but we can copy to and from the D class. This hack makes it
possible to represent the setcc instruction without having i1 as a legal type.

In most cases, the CC register is set by a "CC = .." or BITTST instruction, and
then used in a conditional branch or move. The code generator thinks it is
moving 32 bits, but the value stays in CC. In other cases, the result of a
comparison is actually used as am i32 number, and CC will be copied to a D
register.

* Stack frames
** TODO Use Push/Pop instructions
We should use the push/pop instructions when saving callee-saved
registers. The are smaller, and we may even use push multiple instructions.

** TODO requiresRegisterScavenging
We need more intelligence in determining when the scavenger is needed. We
should keep track of:
- Spilling D16 registers
- Spilling AnyCC registers

* Assembler
** TODO Implement PrintGlobalVariable
** TODO Remove LOAD32sym
It's a hack combining two instructions by concatenation.

* Inline Assembly
** TODO Support all register classes
* DAG combiner
** Create test case for each Illegal SETCC case
The DAG combiner may someimes produce illegal i16 SETCC instructions.

*** TODO SETCC (ctlz x), 5) == const
*** TODO SETCC (and load, const) == const
*** DONE SETCC (zext x) == const
*** TODO SETCC (sext x) == const

* Instruction selection
** TODO Better imediate constants
Like ARM, build constants as small imm + shift.

** TODO Implement cycle counter
We have CYCLES and CYCLES2 registers, but the readcyclecounter intrinsic wants
to return i64, and the code generator doesn't know how to legalize that.

** TODO Instruction alternatives
Some instructions come in different variants for example:

  D = D + D
  P = P + P

Cross combinations are not allowed:

  P = D + D (bad)

Similarly for the subreg pseudo-instructions:

 D16L = EXTRACT_SUBREG D16, bfin_subreg_lo16
 P16L = EXTRACT_SUBREG P16, bfin_subreg_lo16

We want to take advantage of the alternative instructions. This could be done by
changing the DAG after instruction selection.


** Multipatterns for load/store
We should try to identify multipatterns for load and store instructions. The
available instruction matrix is a bit irregular.
