[component_0]
type = Library
name = Target
parent = Libraries
required_libraries = Core MC Support

; This is a convenient group we define (and expect targets to add to) which
; makes it easy for tools to include every target.
[component_1]
type = LibraryGroup
name = all-targets
parent = Libraries

; This is a special group whose required libraries are extended (by llvm-build)
; with the configured native target, if any.
[component_2]
type = LibraryGroup
name = Native
parent = Libraries

; This is a special group whose required libraries are extended (by llvm-build)
; with the configured native code generator, if any.
[component_3]
type = LibraryGroup
name = NativeCodeGen
parent = Libraries

; This is a special group whose required libraries are extended (by llvm-build)
; with the best execution engine (the native JIT, if available, or the
; interpreter).
[component_4]
type = LibraryGroup
name = Engine
parent = Libraries
